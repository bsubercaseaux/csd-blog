      <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are powerful tools
that answer logical and mathematical questions.
As an example, let’s say I want to know whether there exists integers
\(a, b, c\) such that \(3a^{2} -2ab -b^2c = 7\).
To ask an SMT solver, I need to write an SMT query, which is in a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/">standardized format</a> for expressing logical problems. In the SMT query below, the <code>declare-fun</code> command creates a variable (i.e., a
function with no argument), the <code>assert</code> command states the equation
as a constraint. More generally, an SMT query may contain
multiple assertions, and the <code>check-sat</code> command checks if
the query context, i.e., the <em>conjunction</em> of the
assertions, is satisfiable.</p>
<!-- A slight quirk is that the expressions are in prefix form,
where each operator comes before its operand(s). -->
<pre style="background-color:#393939;color:#dedede;"><code><span>(declare-fun a () Int)
</span><span>(declare-fun b () Int)
</span><span>(declare-fun c () Int)
</span><span>(assert 
</span><span>    (=
</span><span>        (+ (* 3 a a) (* -2 a b) (* -1 b (* c b)))
</span><span>        7
</span><span>    )
</span><span>)
</span><span>(check-sat)
</span></code></pre>
<p>The possible answers from the SMT solver can be “Yes”
(satisfiable), “No” (unsatisfiable) or “I don’t know”
(unknown). Suppose the solver responds with “Yes”
(satisfiable) in this case. This is good, because the
question is not so straightforward to me at least, and the
solver gives a definitive answer. What’s more, the solver
provides fairly high assurance about its responses, which
are justified by <strong>precise mathematical reasoning</strong>. For
this example, the solver can also provide a solution, <code>a = 1, b = 2, c = -2</code>, which serves as a checkable witness to
the “Yes” answer.</p>
<p>However, the solver is not perfect, because even a seemingly
benign change to a query can
trip up the SMT solver, causing it to give up. Suppose that
I slightly tweak the formula and ask again:</p>
<!-- $ \exists \, e, f, g \in Z \, | \,
3e^{2} -2ef -e^2g = 7 $
 -->
<pre style="background-color:#393939;color:#dedede;"><code><span>(declare-fun e () Int)
</span><span>(declare-fun f () Int)
</span><span>(declare-fun g () Int)
</span><span>(assert 
</span><span>    (=
</span><span>        (+ (* 3 e e) (* -2 e f) (* -1 f (* g f)))
</span><span>        7
</span><span>    )
</span><span>)
</span><span>(check-sat)

<p>This time, the following may happen: the solver gives up,
saying “I don’t know” to this new query. Understandably,
this may seem puzzling. As you might have noticed, the two
queries are essentially the same, just with different
variable names.
Is it even a legitimate move for it to give up? Why would the solver give different responses?</p>
<p>Before you get mad at the solver (this is a made-up example
BTW), let me explain why it can unexpectedly fail with a
seemingly innocuous query change. As mentioned earlier, the
SMT solver sticks to precise mathematical reasoning.
Therefore, if a best-effort try doesn’t work out, the solver
is allowed to give up, instead of giving bogus answers.
Moreover, the solver heuristics may not be robust against
superficial modifications to the input, leading to
confusing responses on similar inquiries.</p>
<!-- How hard? Well, some questions can
be NP-hard! In fact, the example above pertains to
[Diophantine
equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation),
which are undecidable in general. Therefore, no program can
correctly answer all such questions. The poor solver has to
resort to heuristics, which may not be robust against
superficial modifications to the input query. -->
<!-- ### Instability of SMT Solving -->
<p>What we have observed in this example is the phenomenon of
<strong>SMT instability</strong>, where trivial changes to the input
query may incur large performance variations (or even
different responses) from the solver. While there are many
applications of the SMT solver, in this blog post, I will focus
on instability in <strong>SMT-based program verification</strong>, where
we ask the solver to prove programs correct. More
concretely, instability manifests as a butterfly effect:
even tiny, superficial changes in the program may lead to
noticeable change in proof performance and even spurious
verification failures.</p>
<!-- spurious proof failures, where a previously proven program
may be (wrongfully) rejected after trivial changes to the
source code.  -->
<h1 id="instability-in-smt-based-program-verification">Instability in SMT-based Program Verification</h1>
<p>Please allow me to briefly explain why program verification
is useful, how SMT solvers can help with verification, and
why instability comes up as a concern. If you are already
familiar with the background topic, please feel free to skip
this section.</p>
<p>As programmers, we often make informal claims about our
software. For example, I might say that a filesystem is
crash-safe or an encryption software is secure, etc. However, as
many of us can testify, these claims might be
unfounded or even straight-up wrong. Sometimes, the cost of software failure can be catastrophic (e.g., consider <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88">spacecrafts</a> or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">medical devices</a>).
Fortunately, formal
verification offers a path to move beyond informal claims and avoid such
disasters.</p>
<p>Formal verification uses proofs to show that the code meets
its specification. In comparison to testing, formal
verification offers a higher level of assurance, since it
reasons about the program’s behavior for <em>all possible
inputs</em>, not just the ones in the test cases. In a
more-or-less <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics">standard
algorithm</a>,
program properties can be encoded as logical statements,
often called the verification conditions (VCs). Essentially, the
task of formal verification is to prove that the VCs hold.</p>
<p>In SMT-based program verification, the solver takes as input
the VCs and search for proofs. As you might have gathered
from the previous example, the SMT solver can reason about
pretty complex logical statements. In this way, the solver
enables a high degree of automation, allowing the developer
to skip manual and tedious proof steps. This methodology has
thus made verification of complex software systems a
reality.</p>
<p>However, SMT-based automation also introduces the problem of
instability. Verified software, similar to regular software,
has an iterative development process. As the developers make
incremental changes to the code, corresponding queries also
change constantly. Even seemingly trivial changes, such as
renaming a variable would create a different query. As we
have discussed, the solver may not respond consistently to
these changes, leading to confusing verification results and
frustrated developers.</p>
<h1 id="detecting-instability-with-mariposa">Detecting Instability with Mariposa</h1>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of instability, let’s
try to quantify it more systematically. I will
introduce the methodology used in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/secure-foundations/mariposa">Mariposa</a>, a tool that we
have built to measure and detect instability. In this blog post, I will
stick to the key intuitions and elide the details. For a
more thorough discussion, I encourage you to check out our
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bparno/papers/mariposa.pdf">paper</a>. At a high level, given an original query \( q \) and
an SMT solver \( s \), Mariposa answers the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the query-solver pair \((q, s)\) stable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Intuitively, instability means that \( s
\) experiences a mix of successes and failures when we apply seemingly irrelevant mutations to
\( q \). Mariposa detects instability by generating a set
of mutated queries and evaluating the performance of \( s
\) on each mutant. In this section, I will explain what
mutations are used, and how Mariposa decides the stability
status of the query-solver pair.</p>
<h2 id="what-mutations-to-use">What Mutations to Use?</h2>
<p>In Mariposa, a mutation method needs to preserve not only
the semantic meaning but also the syntactic structures of a
query. More precisely, the original query \( q \) and its
mutant \( q’ \) need to be both semantically equivalent
and syntactically isomorphic.</p>
<!-- it seems reasonable to expect similar performance from
the solver on both queries. -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Equivalence</strong>. \( q \) and \( q’ \) are semantically equivalent
when there is a bijection between the set of proofs for \( q \)
and those for \( q’ \) . In other words, a proof of \( q \) can be
transformed into a proof of \( q’ \) , and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syntactic Isomorphism</strong>. \( q \) and \( q’ \)  are
syntactically isomorphic if there exists a bijection between
the symbols (e.g., variables) and commands (e.g.,
<code>assert</code>). In other words, each symbol or command in \( q \)  has
a counterpart in \( q’ \), and vice versa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For our concrete experiments, we are interested in mutations
that also correspond to common development practices.
Specifically, we consider the following three mutation
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assertion Shuffling</strong>. Reordering of source-level lemmas
or methods is a common practice when developing verified
software. Such reordering roughly corresponds to shuffling
the commands in the query. Since an SMT query is a
conjunction of assertions, the assertion order does not
impact query semantics. Further, shuffling the assertions
guarantees syntactic isomorphism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbol Renaming</strong>. It is common to rename source-level
methods, types, or variables, which roughly corresponds to
renaming the symbols in the SMT queries. As long as the
symbol names are used consistently, Renaming preserves
semantic equivalence and syntactic isomorphism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomness Reseeding</strong>. SMT solvers optionally take as
input a random seed, which is used in some of their
non-deterministic choices. Changing the seed has no effect
on the query’s semantics but is known to affect the solver’s
performance. While technically not a mutation, reseeding has
been used as a proxy for measuring instability, which is why
we have included it here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Historically, some verification tools have
attempted to use reseeding to measure instability: Dafny and
F* have options to run the same query multiple times with
different random seeds and report the number of failures
encountered.
 -->
<p>As an example, suppose we have a query \( q \) with \(
100 \) assertions. If we exhaustively apply shuffling to
\( q \), we obtain a set of mutated queries, with \(100!
\approx 9 \times 10^{157}\) permutations of \( q \).</p>
<h2 id="is-it-stable-or-not">Is it Stable or Not?</h2>
<p>Whether a query-solver pair \( (q, s) \) is stable or not
depends on how the mutants perform. A natural measure is the
<strong>Mutant Success Rate</strong>, i.e., the percentage of \( q\)’s
mutants that are verified by \( s \). Intuitively, the
success rate, denoted by \(r\), reflects performance
consistency. A low \(r\) indicates consistently poor
results; a high \(r\) indicates consistently good results;
and a moderate \(r\) indicates inconsistent results, i.e.,
instability.</p>
<p>Mariposa thus introduces four stability categories based on \(r\): <strong>unsolvable</strong>, <strong>unstable</strong>, <strong>stable</strong>, and <strong>inconclusive</strong>.<br />
The scheme includes two additional parameters:
\(r_{solvable}\) and \(r_{stable}\), corresponding to
the lower and upper range for unstable queries. In our
concrete experiments, we set \(r_{solvable} = 5\% \) and
\(r_{stable} = 95\%\).</p>
<img src="./mariposa_categories.png" alt="intuition of Mariposa Categories" style="width:80%">
<p>The <strong>inconclusive</strong> category is needed as a result of
statistical tests. Specifically, it is often infeasible to
enumerate all the mutants of a query and obtain the true
success rate. (Think about the \(100!\) mutants or more!)
Therefore, Mariposa uses random sampling to <strong>estimate</strong> the
success rate. When the estimated success rate based on the
sampled mutants is close to the boundaries, the statistical
test may not result in enough confidence to place \( (q, s)
\) in any of the previous three categories, yielding an
inconclusive result.</p>
<!-- , which correspond
respectively to the lower and upper bounds of the success
rate range for unstable queries. -->
<!-- The scheme
includes two additional parameters: \\(r_{solvable}\\)  and
r stable , which correspond respectively to the lower and
upper bounds of the success rate range for unstable queries. -->
<!-- * **Unsolvable**: \\(r < r_{solvable}  \\) 
* **Unstable**: \\(  r_{solvable} \leq  r \leq  r_{stable} \\)
* **Stable**: \\( r_{stable} < r \\)
* **Inconclusive**. This category is needed due to a
technicality that is less important for our discussion
here. In short, because Mariposa uses random sampling to
estimate the success rate, sometimes statistical tests do
not result in enough confidence to place \\( (q, s) \\) in
any of the previous three categories. -->
<h1 id="measuring-instability-in-the-wild">Measuring Instability in the Wild</h1>
<p>So far we have discussed Mariposa’s methodology to detect
and quantify instability. How much instability is there in
practice? Let me share some experimental results from
existing program verification projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-instability">How Much Instability?</h2>
<p>For our experiments, we focus on the Z3 SMT solver, with
which the projects were developed. We are interested in both
the current and historical status of SMT stability.
Therefore, in addition to the latest Z3 solver (version
4.12.1, as of the work), we include seven legacy versions of
Z3, with the earliest released in
2015. In particular, for each project we include its
artifact solver, which is the version used in the project’s
artifact.</p>
<p>We run each project-solver pair through Mariposa. For each
original query in a project, Mariposa outputs a stability
category. Therefore, each project-solver pair is associated with
a breakdown of different stability categories, plotted as
stacked bars in In Figure 1. Focusing on Z3 4.12.1 (the right-most
group), the unstable proportion is the highest in
Komodo\(_D \) (\( 5.0\% \)), and \(2.6\%\) across all queries. This
might not seem like a significant number, but think of the
a regular software project’s continuous integration (CI)   where \(\sim 2\%\) of the test cases may fail
randomly: it would be a nightmare! Nevertheless, developers
have to bear with such burden in SMT-based verification.</p>
<!-- In all project-solver pairs, the majority of queries are
stable. However, a non-trivial amount of instability
persists as well.   -->
<img src="./stability_status.png" alt="historical stability status of Mariposa projects" style="width:100%">
<figcaption>Figure 1: Overall Stability Status. From bottom to top, each stacked bar shows the proportions of unsolvable (lightly shaded), unstable
(deeply shaded), and inconclusive (uncolored) queries. The remaining portion of the queries (stacking each bar to 100%), not shown, are
stable. The solver version used for each project’s artifact is marked with a star (⋆). </figcaption>
<br>
<p>Now that we know instability is not a rare occurrence, the
next question is: what gives? Well, first off, instability
is a property that is jointly determined by the solver and
the query. Therefore, the causes can roughly be categorized
as solver-related and query-related. Of course, I cannot
possibly be exhaustive here, so let me discuss the
significant ones we have found for each side.</p>
<!-- Before we delve into the details, here is a disclaimer: I
can only cover significant causes   -->
<h1 id="debugging-the-solver">“Debugging” the Solver</h1>
<!-- As we zoom out to the full picture, the projects exhibit
different historical trends. The unstable proportion of
vWasm\\(_F\\) and Komodo\\(_S\\) remain consistently small
across the solver versions.  On the other hand, some
projects seem "overfitted" to their artifact solver, in that
they become less stable with solver upgrades. Specifically,
Komodo\\(_D \\), VeriBetrKV\\(_D \\), and VeriBetrKV\\(_L
\\) show more instability in newer Z3 versions, with a
**noticeable gap** between Z3 4.8.5 and Z3 4.8.8.  -->
<p>As you might have noticed already, in Figure 1, there is a
“gap” between Z3 4.8.5 and 4.8.8, where several projects
suffer from noticeably more instability in the newer
solver. In other words, certain queries used to be stable,
but somehow become unstable with the solver upgrade. Since
the query sets did not change, solver change is responsible for the regression.</p>
<p>We perform further experiments to narrow down the Z3 git
commits that may have been the problem. In the six
experiment projects, \(285\) queries are stable under Z3
4.8.5 but unstable under Z3 4.8.8. For each query in this
set, we run <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a> (which calls Mariposa) to find the
commit to blame, i.e., where the query first becomes
unstable.</p>
<p>There is a total of \(1,453\) commits between the two versions,
among which we identify two most impactful commits. Out of
the \(285\) regressed queries, \(115 (40\%)\) are blamed on commit <code>5177cc4</code>.
Another \(77 (27\%) \)of the queries are blamed on <code>1e770af</code>. The
remaining queries are dispersed across the other commits.</p>
<p>The two commits are small and localized: <code>5177cc4</code> has \( 2
\) changed files with \( 8 \) additions and \( 2 \)
deletions; <code>1e770af</code> has only \( 1 \) changed file with
\( 18 \) additions and \( 3 \) deletions. Both commits
are related to the order of disjunctions in a query’s
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form">conjunctive normal form</a>.
<code>1e770af</code>, the earlier of the two, sorts the disjunctions,
while <code>5177cc4</code> adds a new term ordering, updating the
sorted disjunction order. Similar to
conjunction order, disjunction order does not affect the
semantics, but interacts with other solver heuristics. Therefore,
the change of disjunction order can be thought of as “internal mutations”
to the query, exposing more instability.</p>
<!-- The results suggest that the solver's internal heuristics
can have a significant impact on stability. 
 -->
<h1 id="debugging-the-query">“Debugging” the Query</h1>
<p>The discussion so far is condensed from our work on
Mariposa. However, we have yet to cover the query side of
the problem. To that end, let me share some results in our
follow-up work on query context. As it turns out, the
queries we have studied often contain a large amount of
irrelevant information (assertions). However, the solver may
not need all of the context to find a proof. In fact, the
presence of irrelevant information can cause “confusion” to
the solver, leading to instability.</p>
<!-- , which can be a major source of
instability -->
<h2 id="most-of-the-context-is-irrelevant">Most of the Context is Irrelevant</h2>
<p>Our experiments in this section analyze each query’s
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsatisfiable_core"><strong>core</strong></a>. Recall that an SMT query is a
conjunction of assertions. Upon verification success, the
solver can report a core, which is the subset
of the original assertions constructing the proof.
Therefore, this “slimmed-down” version of the query is an
oracle of <strong>relevant assertions</strong>, and what is excluded from
it can be considered irrelevant.</p>
<p>After acquiring a core, we compare its context to the
original query. Using the assertion count as a proxy for the
“size” of the context, we examine the <strong>Relevance Ratio</strong>: \(
\frac{\# \text{core\ assertions}}{\# \text{original\ assertions}} \times 100\% \). Since a core is a
subset of the original query, the lower this ratio is, the
less context remains, and the more irrelevant context the
original query has.</p>
<img src="./relevance_ratio.png" alt="small cache" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Figure 2:  Query Relevance Ratios. More to the left means more irrelevant contexts. Typically, the vast majority of an original query context is irrelevant. </figcaption>
<p>Figure 2 shows the CDFs of the relevance ratios for
different projects. For example, on the left side lies the
line for Dice\(_F^⋆\). The median relevance ratio is \(
0.06\% \), meaning that for a typical query in the
project, only \( 0.06\% \) of the context is relevant.
Please note that I have excluded Komodo\(_S\) from the
experiment, as its queries each contains only a single
assertion due to special encoding rules. Nevertheless, among
the remaining projects, typically \( 96.23\% – 99.94\%
\) of the context is irrelevant.</p>
<!-- In
vWasm\\(_F \\), the median is \\( 3.77 \\% \\), which is
almost an of order of magnitude higher than the other
projects. This can be attributed to the manual context
tuning vWasm\\(_F \\) developers, who explicitly documented
the tedious effort.  -->
<h2 id="irrelevant-context-harms-stability">Irrelevant Context Harms Stability</h2>
<p>Considering the significant amount of irrelevant context, we
further analyze how that impacts stability, by comparing the
original queries and their core counterparts. Given an
original query \(q\) and its core \(q_c\), we introduce
the following metrics among the possible stability status
transitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Preservation</strong>: given that \( q \) is stable, the probability that \( q_c \) remains stable.</li>
<li><strong>Core Mitigation</strong>: given that  \( q \)  is unstable, the
probability that  \( q_c \) becomes stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the Mariposa tool with Z3 version 4.12.5 in this
experiment. Below we have listed the number of original
queries and the preservation and mitigation scores. As an
example, in the original Komodo\(_D\) queries, \(1,914\)
are stable and \(93\) are unstable. In its core
counterpart, \(99.4\%\) of the stable queries remain
stable, while \(90.3\%\) of the unstable ones become
stable. The vWasm\(_F\) project is the only case where the
core has no mitigation effect. However, its original
unstable query count is very low to begin with.</p>
<!-- As we noted previously,
vWasm\\(_F\\) also starts off with more relevant context
originally. Therefore, the stability of vWasm\\(_F\\) can be
explained by the manual tuning done by the developers. -->

</tbody></table>
<p>Generally, the core is highly likely to preserve what is
stable. Moreover, across all projects, \(78.3\%\) of the
unstable instances can be mitigated by using the core. In
other words, irrelevant context can be thought of as <strong>a
major factor to instability</strong> on the query side! While this
is far from an end-to-end solution, the result suggests a
promising direction to mitigate instability by pruning
irrelevant assertions, which we are exploring in our ongoing
work.</p>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
<p>I will conclude with some TLDRs in case someone has skipped ahead
or wants a quick recap.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SMT solvers is immensely useful for program verification,
but it introduces the problem of instability, where
trivial changes to the input query may incur spurious
verification failures.</li>
<li>Mariposa is a tool (and a methodology) to detect and
quantify instability.</li>
<li>Instability is a real concern in existing SMT-based
program verification projects. \(2.6\%\) of the queries
in our study are unstable using Z3 4.12.1.</li>
<li>Tiny changes in the solver heuristics can cause noticeable
regression in stability. Just \( 2 \) tiny commits to Z3
are responsible for \( 67.3\% \) of the regression in
our study.</li>
<li>Irrelevant context in the queries is a major source of
instability. Typically, \( 96.23\% – 99.94\% \) of the
context is irrelevant, while being responsible for \(
78.3\%\) of the instability observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, I would like to reiterate that
instability is a joint problem of the solver heuristic and
the query property, which will take a joint effort to
address. I hope that the work we have done can help to
improve the stability of SMT-based verification in
future research and practice.</p>
