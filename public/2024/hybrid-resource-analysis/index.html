      <p>Resource analysis of programs aims to infer their worst-case cost bounds. It has
a number of practical use cases. For example, when executing a client’s program
in cloud computing, a cloud-service provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services or
Microsoft Azure) would like to to avoid both over-provisioning resources (which
would reduce profits) and under-provisioning resources (which would violate the
service-level agreement). So the provider would like to to estimate the resource
usage of the client’s program in advance, thereby optimizing resource
allocation.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to resource analysis: <em>static analysis</em> and
<em>data-driven analysis</em>. Static analysis infers a cost bound by examining the
source code and reasoning about all theoretically possible behaviors of a
program, including its worst-case behavior. Data-driven analysis
first runs the program on many inputs and records the execution costs. It then
analyzes the cost measurements to infer a cost bound.</p>
<p>Static and data-driven analyses have complementary strengths and weaknesses.
Static analysis is <em>sound</em>: if it returns some candidate cost bound, it is
guaranteed to be a valid upper bound on the actual execution cost. However,
resource analysis for a Turing-complete language is generally undecidable.
Consequently, static analysis is <em>incomplete</em>: no matter how clever the static
analysis is, there always exists a program that the static analysis cannot
handle. In contrast to static analysis, data-driven analysis can infer a cost
bound for any program. However, because data-driven analysis cannot rigorously
reason about the program’s worst-case behavior, data-driven analysis offers no
soundness guarantees of its inferred cost bounds.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we describe how to integrate static and data-driven resource
analyses into <em>hybrid resource analysis</em>. By combining the two complementary
analysis techniques, hybrid resource analysis partially retains their respective
strengths while mitigating their weaknesses. We first introduce static resource
analysis, followed by data-driven resource analysis. We then describe hybrid
resource analysis and demonstrate its advantages over static and data-driven
analyses using an example of a linear-time selection algorithm.</p>
<h1 id="formulation-of-resource-analysis">Formulation of Resource Analysis</h1>
<p>Given a program \(P\), the goal of resource analysis is to infer its
worst-case cost bound. Concretely, it is a function \(\text{cost}_{P} (x)\)
parametric in an input \(x\) (or its size \(\lvert x \rvert\)) to the
program \(P\) such that, for any input \(x\), the value \(\text{cost}_{P}
(x)\) is a correct upper bound of the execution cost of \(P(x)\). The
execution cost of the program \(P\) is defined by a resource metric such as
running time, memory, or energy.</p>
<p>To specify a resource metric of interest, a user inserts an instruction <code>tick q</code>
throughout their code, where <code>q</code> is a (positive or negative) number. The
instruction indicates that <code>q</code> many resources are consumed. For example, if we
are interested in the amount of memory (in bits) consumed by a program, whenever
a 64-bit memory cell is allocated in the source code, we indicate it by
inserting an instruction <code>tick 64</code>.</p>
<h1 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h1>
<p>To automate resource analysis, <em>static resource analysis</em> automatically analyzes
the source code of a program. In this blog post, we focus on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1926385.1926427">Automatic
Amortized Resource Analysis</a>
(AARA) as a concrete example of state-of-the-art static resource analysis.
Taking as input a functional program \(P\), AARA tries to automatically infer
a polynomial cost bound of the program \(P\).</p>
<h2 id="aara">AARA</h2>
<p>AARA builds on the potential method from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0606031">amortized
analysis</a>. Every data structure
during program execution is equipped with <em>potential</em>, which we can consider as
fuel for computation. To perform computation, data structures must come with
enough potential to pay for the cost of computation. For example, if we are to
run an instruction <code>tick 64</code>, we must have at least 64 units of potential
available. The remaining potential can be later used to pay for subsequent
computation. In the potential method, our goal is to figure out an appropriate
amount of potential to store in data structures such that, whenever they go
through computation, they have enough potential to pay for it. The overall cost
is then bounded above by the initial potential minus the final potential stored
in the data structures. So the difference between the initial and final
potential serves as a cost bound.</p>
<p>AARA uses types to express the amount of potential stored in data structures.
For illustration, consider a variable \(x\) of the integer-list type \(
L(\mathtt{int}) \). If we want the list \(x\) to come with one unit of
potential per list element, we write
$$
x: L^{1} (\mathtt{int})
$$
where the superscript 1 indicates the amount of potential stored in each list
element. The type \(L^{1} (\mathtt{int})\) is called a <em>resource-annotated
type</em>, and the superscript 1 is called a <em>resource annotation</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a slightly more complicated example. Consider function <code>split</code>
that splits an input list \(x\) into two equal halves. The function traverses
the input \(x\) and processes each list element. If the cost of processing
each element is one, the total computational cost is equal to the input list
length \( \lvert x \rvert\). We express the resource usage of the function
<code>split</code> by
$$
x : L^{1} (\mathtt{int}) \vdash \mathtt{split} \; x : L^{0} (\mathtt{int}) \times L^{0} (\mathtt{int})
$$
On the left-hand side of the turnstile (i.e., \(\vdash\)), we have \(x :
L^{1} (\mathtt{int})\), which means the input \(x\) carries one unit of
potential per element. On the right-hand side of the turnstile, we have
\(\mathtt{split} \; x : L^{0} (\mathtt{int}) \times L^{0} (\mathtt{int})\),
which means the two output lists of function <code>split</code> each carry zero units of
potential per element. This assignment of potential makes sense. In the input
list \(x\), each element initially carries one unit of potential. This
potential is used to pay for the cost of function <code>split</code>, and the
remaining zero units of potential are stored in the two output lists after
splitting. The difference between the input potential (i.e., \(1 \cdot \lvert x
\rvert\)) and output potential (i.e., zero) immediately translates to the cost
bound \(\lvert x \vert\) of function <code>split</code>.</p>
<p>Although the function <code>split</code> stores zero potential in the output, we will need
a positive amount of potential in the output if it later undergoes computation
that demands potential. In such a case, we can increase the potential stored in
the input and output of the function <code>split</code>. For example, another valid
assignment of potential is
$$
x : L^{3} (\mathtt{int}) \vdash \mathtt{split} \; x : L^{2} (\mathtt{int}) \times L^{2} (\mathtt{int})
$$
where the input carries three units of potential per list element and the output
carries two unit of potential, which can be used to pay for subsequent
computation.</p>
<p>Given a program \(P\), how do we infer its resource-annotated type? First, we
assign numeric variables to all inputs and outputs that appear in \(P\)’s
source code. These variables stand for (yet-to-be-determined) resource
annotations, which encode the amounts of potential. For example, in the program
\(\mathtt{split} \; x\), the input and output of the whole program are
assigned variables \(q_0, q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\):
$$
x : L^{q_0} (\mathtt{int}) \vdash \mathtt{split} \; x : L^{q_1} (\mathtt{int}) \times L^{q_2} (\mathtt{int})
$$</p>
<p>We then walk through the source code, collecting linear constraints that relate
the variables assigned to the inputs and outputs. For example, if the program
\(P\) contains instruction <code>tick 64</code>, AARA’s type system imposes a linear
constraint that the input potential must be at least 64 plus the leftover
potential after running <code>tick 64</code>. In the example of \(\mathtt{split} \; x\),
we obtain two linear constraints
$$
q_1 + 1 \leq q_0 \qquad q_2 + 1 \leq q_0
$$</p>
<p>Finally, we solve the linear constraints using a linear-program (LP) solver. If
we obtain a solution, we can extract a resource-annotated type of the program
\(P\).</p>
<h2 id="incompleteness">Incompleteness</h2>
<p>The static resource analysis technique AARA is sound but incomplete. Soundness
means that, if AARA returns a candidate cost bound, it is guaranteed to be a
valid worst-case cost bound. However, AARA is incomplete: even if a program
\(P\) has a polynomial cost bound, AARA can fail to infer it. This happens
when the linear constraints collected during type inference are unsolvable. In
fact, this limitation is not unique to AARA. All static resource analysis
techniques suffer incompleteness because resource analysis is undecidable in
general.</p>
<p>To illustrate AARA’s incompleteness, let us consider the median-of-medians-based
linear-time selection algorithm. Given an input list \(x\) and an input
integer \(i\), the selection algorithm returns the \(i\)-th smallest element
in the list \(x\).</p>
<p>In this algorithm, we split input list \(x\) into blocks of five elements and
compute each block’s median (e.g., by brute force). We then recursively call the
algorithm on these medians to compute their median \(m\). The median of
medians \(m\) (hence the name of the algorithm) is used to partition the input
list \(x\) into two lists, \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). To prove the linear time
complexity of this algorithm, we must show that the sublists \(x_1\) and
\(x_2\) are each at most \(7/10\) of the list \(x\). Intuitively, the
median of medians \(m\) partitions the list \(x\) <em>evenly</em> (up to some
factor) even in the worst case.</p>
<p>However, AARA cannot reason about the mathematical properties of medians. As a
result, it cannot conclude that the median of medians \(m\) splits the list
\(x\) evenly. Instead, AARA deduces that, in the worst case, the list \(x\)
is split unevenly into a singleton list (i.e., containing only one element) and
the remaining sublist. If the list \(x\) were split this way, the worst-case
time complexity would be exponential. Hence, AARA is unable to infer a
polynomial cost bound for this algorithm even though it has a linear cost bound.
Furthermore, we are not aware of static analysis techniques that can correctly
infer linear cost bounds for the linear-time selection algorithm.</p>
<h1 id="data-driven-analysis">Data-Driven Analysis</h1>
<p>The second approach to automatic resource analysis is <em>data-driven resource
analysis</em>. It starts with collecting cost measurements of the program \(P\).
Given inputs \( x_1, \ldots, x_n\), we run \( P \; x_i \) for each \(1
\leq i \leq n\) and record its output  \( y_{i} \) and execution cost \(c_i
\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\). This yields a runtime cost dataset \(\mathcal{D}\)
defined as
$$
\mathcal{D} \coloneqq \{ (x_i, y_i, c_i) \mid 1 \leq i \leq n \}
$$
The dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) records output \(y_i\) as well as input
\(x_i\) since we need to know output sizes to calculate a cost bound (i.e.,
the difference between the input and output potential). We then infer a cost
bound of the program \(P\) by analyzing the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\). We have
a variety of choices for data-analysis techniques, ranging from linear
regression to deep learning.</p>
<h2 id="bayesian-resource-analysis">Bayesian Resource Analysis</h2>
<p>This blog post introduces <em>Bayesian resource analysis</em>, where we apply <em>Bayesian
inference</em> to resource analysis. In abstract, the goal of Bayesian inference is
to infer <em>latent variables</em> \(\theta\) (i.e., variables that we want to know
but cannot observe) from <em>observed variables</em> \(D\) (i.e., variables whose
concrete values are available) using Bayes’ rule from probability theory. In
Bayesian resource analysis, latent variables \(\theta\) are resource
annotations (i.e., cost bounds), and observed variables \(D\) are the runtime
cost dataset of the program.</p>
<p>To conduct Bayesian resource analysis, the user first provides a <em>probabilistic
model</em>, which specifies a joint probability distribution \( p (\theta, D) \)
of resource annotations \(\theta\) and dataset \(D\). Next, by Bayes’ rule,
the <em>posterior distribution</em> of the cost bound \(\theta\) conditioned on a
concrete dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) is given by
$$
p (\theta \mid D = \mathcal{D})
= \frac{p (\theta, D = \mathcal{D})}{p (D = \mathcal{D})}
= \frac{p (\theta, D = \mathcal{D})}{\int p (\theta, D = \mathcal{D}) \, \mathrm{d} \theta}
$$
This equation suggests that we can compute the posterior distribution \(p
(\theta \mid D = \mathcal{D})\) by taking the ratio between the joint
distribution \(p (\theta, D = \mathcal{D})\) and the denominator \(\int p
(\theta, D = \mathcal{D}) \, \mathrm{d} \theta\). However, because the
denominator is an integral over the space of the resource annotations
\(\theta\), which may have many dimensions, it is often intractable to compute
the denominator. As a result, we cannot precisely compute the posterior
distribution \(p (\theta \mid D = \mathcal{D})\) by directly applying Bayes’
rule.</p>
<p>Instead, in practice, we run a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm,
drawing a large number of samples from the posterior distribution. We then use
these samples, which serve as an approximation of the posterior distribution, to
estimate various properties (e.g., mean, median, variance, etc.) of the
posterior distribution.</p>
<p>Figure 1 displays a schematic diagram of Bayesian resource analysis. We perform
Bayesian inference to infer a posterior distribution of cost bounds (blue lines)
from the runtime cost measurements (black dots).</p>

inference to infer a posterior distribution of cost bounds (blue lines) from the
runtime cost measurements (black dots).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To illustrate Bayesian resource analysis, consider the function <code>split</code> that was
introduced <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/hybrid-resource-analysis/#aara">earlier</a>. Its resource-annotated type has the form
$$
x : L^{q_0} (\mathtt{int}) \vdash \mathtt{split} \; x : L^{q_1} (\mathtt{int}) \times L^{q_2} (\mathtt{int})
$$
where the resource annotations \(q_0, q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) are
to be inferred by Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>Let a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) of runtime cost
measurements be
$$
\mathcal{D} \coloneqq \{(x_i,(y_{i,1}, y_{i,2}),c_i) \mid 1 \leq i \leq n \}
$$
where \(x_i\) is an input list, \((y_{i,1}, y_{i,2})\) is a pair of
two output lists, and \(c_i\) is the cost of running \(\mathtt{split} \;
x_i\).</p>
<p>The user constructs a probabilistic model \(p (\theta, D)\) based on whatever
domain knowledge<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#domain_knowledge">1</a></sup> they have. For example, a probabilistic
model for <code>split</code> can be
$$
\begin{aligned}
q_0, q_1, q_2 &amp; \sim \mathrm{Normal}_{[0, \infty)}(0, 5) \\
c_{i, \text{predict}} &amp; = q_0 \lvert x_i \rvert - q_1 \lvert y_{i,1} \rvert - q_2 \lvert y_{i,2} \rvert &amp; \qquad (i = 1, \ldots, n) \\
c_i &amp; \sim \mathrm{Normal}_{[0, c_{i, \text{predict}}]}(c_{i, \text{predict}}, 2) &amp; (i = 1, \ldots, n)
\end{aligned}
$$
The first line states that the resource annotations \(q_0, q_1, q_2\) follow a
normal distribution truncated to the non-negative region. In the second line,
the predicted costs \(c_{i, \text{predict}}\) are defined as \( q_1 \lvert
v_i \rvert - q_2 \lvert y_{i,1} \rvert - q_3 \lvert y_{i,2} \rvert \),
which is the difference between input and output potential. The third line
states that the observed costs \(c_i\) from the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\)
follow a normal distribution truncated to the interval \([0, c_{i,
\text{predict}}]\). The distribution is truncated because the prediction of a
<em>worst-case</em> cost bound must be larger than or equal to the observed cost.</p>
<h2 id="unsoundness">Unsoundness</h2>
<p>Data-driven analysis can infer a cost bound for any program \(P\), provided
that it terminates. When we construct a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) of the program
\(P\)’s runtime cost measurements, the program must terminate on all inputs;
otherwise, we will never finish collecting runtime cost measurements. Once we
finish data collection, we statistically infer a polynomial cost bound from the
dataset \(\mathcal{D}\). As the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) is finite, for any
degree \(d \geq 0\), we always have some degree-\(d\) polynomial bound
\(\text{cost}_P\) that lies above all runtime cost measurements of
\(\mathcal{D}\). Therefore, data-driven analysis always returns an inference
result.</p>
<p>However, data-driven analysis lacks the soundness guarantee<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#soundness">2</a></sup> of
inference results. Data-driven analysis examines runtime cost data of the input
program \(P\), rather than its source code. Consequently, data-driven analysis
cannot reason about the theoretically worst-case behavior of the program
\(P\), failing to provide a soundness guarantee.</p>
<p>For illustration, we ran Bayesian resource analysis on the
median-of-medians-based linear-time selection algorithm. To collect cost
measurements, we randomly generated input lists. Figure 2 plots the inferred
posterior distribution of cost bounds. Black dots are runtime cost measurements.
The light-blue shade is the 10-90th percentile range of the posterior
distribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line is the
true worst-case cost bound.</p>

selection algorithm. Black dots are runtime cost measurements. The light-blue
shade is the 10-90th percentile range of the cost bounds sampled from the
posterior distribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line
is the true worst-case cost bound.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although the inferred cost bounds (light-blue shade) all lie above the observed
costs (black dots), they are unsound worst-case cost bounds since they lie below
the true worst-case cost bound (red line). The true cost bound (red line) is
significantly larger than observed costs (black dots) because, when inputs are
randomly generated, the worst-case behavior of the selection algorithm rarely
arises.</p>
<p>Certainly, we can fix this problem by adjusting the probabilistic model such
that it adds more buffer on top of the maximum observed costs in the dataset
\(\mathcal{D}\). However, it is difficult to tell a priori how much buffer we
should add. On the other hand, static analysis is better suited for reasoning
about the worst-case behavior than data-driven analysis. But if we perform
static analysis on the entire source code of the linear-time selection
algorithm, the analysis fails as described <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/hybrid-resource-analysis/#incompleteness">earlier</a>. Can we
perform static analysis on a fragment of the source code and data-driven
analysis on the rest?</p>
<h1 id="hybrid-analysis">Hybrid Analysis</h1>
<p>To overcome the limitations of purely static analysis (e.g., conventional AARA)
and purely data-driven analysis (e.g., Bayesian resource analysis), we integrate
them into a framework called hybrid AARA.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-aara">Hybrid AARA</h2>
<p>First, a user indicates which part of the source code should be analyzed by
data-driven analysis. For example, if we want expression <code>e</code> to be analyzed by
data-driven analysis, we enclose <code>e</code> with the annotation <code>statistics</code>, resulting
in <code>statistics(e)</code>. The rest of the source code will be analyzed by static
analysis. To construct a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) of runtime cost measurements,
we run the program \(P\) on many inputs (to \(P\)) and record the inputs,
outputs, and costs of the expression <code>e</code> inside <code>statistics(e)</code>. Here, the input
to the expression <code>e</code> is its evaluation context (i.e., the values of free
variables appearing in <code>e</code>) during the program \(P\)’s execution.</p>
<p>The data-driven analysis of the expression <code>e</code> incorporates its contextual
information at runtime as the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) captures this contextual
information. For example, suppose <code>statistics(e)</code> appears inside the if-branch
of a conditional expression <code>if ... then ... else ...</code>. If the if-branch
satisfies some invariant (e.g., inside the if-branch, variable <code>x</code> appearing
inside <code>e</code> is even), then all measurements recorded in the dataset
\(\mathcal{D}\) satisfy this invariant. Thus, data-driven analysis does not
analyze the expression <code>e</code> in isolation from its context.</p>
<p>Next, we infer a cost bound in hybrid AARA. Given a program \(P\) containing
<code>statistics(e)</code> for some expression <code>e</code>, we perform data-driven analysis on <code>e</code>
and static analysis on the rest of the source code, and then combine their
inference results. Just like we did for the cost-bound inference of
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/hybrid-resource-analysis/#aara">conventional AARA</a>, we assign variables to inputs and outputs throughout
the source code of the program \(P\), where these variables stand for
yet-to-be-inferred resource annotations. In hybrid AARA, however, we do not
assign variables <em>inside</em> the expression <code>e</code>. That is, the expression <code>e</code> is
treated as a black box whose source code is invisible. Let \(\theta_e\) be the
set of resource annotations in the input and output of the expression
<code>statistics(e)</code>. Also, let \(\theta \supseteq \theta_e\) be a set of all
variables in the program \(P\)’s entire source code.</p>
<p>A key challenge in hybrid AARA is the interface between conventional AARA and
Bayesian resource analysis. Suppose conventional AARA generates a set \(C\) of
linear constraints over the variables \(\theta\). Any solution to the linear
constraints \(C\) is a valid cost bound. Conventional AARA optimizes the
variables \(\theta\) subject to the linear constraints \(C\). This
optimization problem is solved by an LP solver. On the other hand, Bayesian
resource analysis infers a posterior distribution of the variables \(\theta_e
\subseteq \theta\) by running a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm.
Thus, conventional AARA and Bayesian resource analysis both involve the
variables \(\theta_e\) in common, but they each use different algorithms for
inference. How do we design their interface?</p>
<p>One idea is to restrict the state space of the sampling algorithm to the
feasible region of the linear constraints \(C\). We first construct a
probabilistic model over all variables \(\theta \supseteq \theta_e\), which
represent resource annotations in the program \(P\)’s source code. We then run
a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm over these variables, subject to
the linear constraints \(C\). Thanks to the constraints \(C\), any cost
bound drawn from the posterior distribution is a valid cost bound according to
conventional AARA.</p>
<p>To implement hybrid AARA, we rely on recent advances in the literature of
sampling algorithms. In 2021, a C++ library
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GeomScale/volesti">volesti</a> started to support
sampling from a user-specified probability distribution subject to arbitrary
linear constraints. This is the first (and so far, only) tool that supports such
sampling. Popular programming languages for Bayesian inference, such as
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>, only support box constraints (i.e., upper and
lower bounds) on random variables, but not arbitrary linear constraints that may
involve multiple variables.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>We ran Hybrid AARA on the linear-time selection algorithm. Inside the selection
algorithm’s source code, the code fragment <code>partition x m</code>, which partitions
list <code>x</code> around the median of medians <code>m</code>, is analyzed by data-driven analysis.
The rest of the source code is analyzed by static analysis. Figure 3 displays
the inference results.</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 3. Inference results of hybrid AARA for the linear-time selection
algorithm. Black dots are runtime cost measurements. The light-blue shade is the
10-90th percentile range of the cost bounds sampled from the posterior
distribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line is the
true cost bound.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Figure 3, the 10-90th percentile ranges (light-blue shade) of inferred cost
bounds now contain or lie above the ground truth (red line). This is a
significant improvement over Bayesian resource analysis (Figure 2), where the
inferred cost bounds are below the true worst-case bounds.</p>
<p>More generally, we have evaluated hybrid AARA on a suite of seven benchmarks:
<code>MapAppend</code>, <code>Concat</code>, <code>InsertionSort2</code>, <code>QuickSort</code>, <code>QuickSelection</code>,
<code>MedianOfMedians</code> (this is the linear-time selection algorithm we have seen in
this blog post), and <code>ZAlgorithm</code>. Conventional AARA fails in all benchmarks as
they each contain a code fragment that cannot be analyzed statically by
conventional AARA. Further, in all benchmarks, hybrid AARA infers cost bounds
closer to the true worst-case cost bounds than purely data-driven resource
analysis. Thus, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of hybrid resource
analysis: hybrid analysis infers more accurate worst-case cost bounds than
purely data-driven analysis, while overcoming the incompleteness of purely
static analysis. The details of the evaluation can be found in out paper <em>Robust
Resource Bounds with Static Analysis and Bayesian Inference</em>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Hybrid resource analysis combines purely static analysis, which offers soundness
guarantees of worst-case cost bounds but is incomplete, and purely data-driven
analysis, which is not sound but can infer a cost bound for any program. By
combining these two complementary analysis techniques, hybrid resource analysis
successfully infers cost bounds that neither purely static analysis nor purely
data-driven analysis can infer. This is demonstrated by the experiment results
of the linear-time selection algorithm.</p>
<p>Hybrid AARA has a limitation that its data-driven analysis only infers resource
annotations, but not other quantities (e.g., depth of recursion). As a result,
hybrid AARA cannot handle some programs such as bubble sort. In bubble sort,
conventional AARA cannot infer the number of recursive calls, but it can still
correctly infer a cost bound of each recursive call. Therefore, ideally, we
would like to infer (i) the number of recursive calls by data-driven analysis
and (ii) the cost of each recursive call by conventional AARA. This requires a
different hybrid analysis technique from hybrid AARA presented in this blog
post, and we plan to investigate it as future work.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="domain_knowledge"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>In contrast to static analysis, data-driven analysis
(including Bayesian resource analysis) always requires the user’s domain
knowledge to construct a statistical model. This dependency on domain
knowledge is inherent in statistics: the inference result depends on our
choice of data-analysis methodologies (e.g., optimization or Bayesian
inference), statistical models, and hyperparameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="soundness"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Here, by the lack of soundness guarantee, we mean that the cost
bound inferred by data-driven analysis is not guaranteed to be a valid
worst-case cost bound for all possible inputs to the program. Nonetheless,
data-driven analysis is sound with respect to the probabilistic model and
dataset used, as long as we use a correct inference algorithm.</p>
