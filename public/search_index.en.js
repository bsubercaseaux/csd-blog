blog post is adapted from the Delphi blog, originally published on March 10th, 2021. Again, thank you to the Allegheny County Health Department, the DELPHI Group, Chris Scott, and Roni Rosenfeld.\nOne of the Delphi Group’s goals is to create informative tools for healthcare organizations. Tools are only useful if the insights they provide can inform concrete actions. That is to say these tools must provide actionable intelligence. In early November 2020, as COVID case rates in Allegheny County continued to rise, the Delphi Group partnered with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) to create such tools for investigating if hospitals located in the county would run out of hospital beds for COVID patients (Fig. 1).\n\n\nFig. 1: Hospitalizations Due to COVID-19 and New Cases from Positive PCR Tests in Allegheny County (WPRDC Data 1)\nBased on its planning, the ACHD needed at least a week to open emergency COVID facilities. If the emergency space wasn’t open and hospital beds ran out, mortality rates could soar. But, if we didn’t need the facility, that decision would have stretched already thin resources. Many of the hospitals in Allegheny County were in contact, but each hospital system only had visibility into its own facilities. We wanted to offer a more holistic picture of hospital resources for ACHD to assist in its planning.\nA Probabilistic Approach\nTo provide county-level intelligence on hospital bed usage, we developed Cases2Beds2.\nTo extrapolate beds utilization 1-2 weeks in the future, we needed to estimate:\n\nThe probability that a person who tested positive for COVID-19 would require hospitalization\nHow many days after testing a person would be hospitalized\nHow long a person with COVID would stay in the hospital\nThe current number of positive COVID tests\n\nThese values vary by demographic factors, most notably age (Fig. 2), and to a lesser extent, sex and race.\n\n\nFig. 2: Age Group Comparisons based on the Allegheny County COVID-19 Tableau 3\nWe used public data from Allegheny County about the number of people tested, test positivity rate, and hospitalization rate, broken down by the aforementioned demographic factors.\nWe also acquired information for two critical parameters:\n\nOffset: Offset is the number of days between the day of testing (called specimen collection date) and the first day of hospitalization. For example, if the test date were 5 days before hospitalization, the offset would be 5 days. Also, if the test date is the hospital admit date, the offset would be 0 days (or sometimes, if, for example, they are admitted at midnight, -1 or +1 days). Notably, the offset can be negative, meaning a person may have been tested some days or weeks after admission.\nLength of Stay: The length of stay is approximately how many days a person uses a bed in the hospital (± 1 day).\n\nGiven the hospitalization rate, the offset distribution, and the length of stay distribution, we can simulate multiple futures for any given set of positive cases and their testing dates. Estimating the future given a set of probabilities is a common problem and a possible approach is called a Monte Carlo simulation. This process ultimately shows the expected distribution of the number of beds needed each day.\nMonte Carlo simulations involve running a large number of scenarios based on a set of probabilities. The more scenarios run, the more accurate the model tends to be. For example, if you gave 1000 people one dart to throw at a dartboard, even though each throw may not be very good, you’d still be able to get a pretty good idea of where the bull’s eye is after 1000 throws. This is the same principle we applied for Cases2Beds – after many simulations, we had a good idea of how many beds might be needed in the next two weeks.\nOur prototype Monte Carlo simulation was written in Python and had a runtime of a few minutes. However, because the simulation works best with probabilities derived from Protected Health Information (PHI), ACHD needed to run it privately and offline so there would be no data transmission. Thus, any type of web application (which would transmit data to our servers) was ruled out. Even asking ACHD to run our Python software on their machines fell into a grey area. However, Microsoft Excel was easy to use and supported by ACHD. So we converted Cases2Beds into a spreadsheet.\nIt is relatively straightforward to port the Python application to VBScript macros for Microsoft Excel. However, those macros aren’t designed to run large simulations, and we saw that the time required to generate a model was far worse, bordering on unusable.\nAn Alternative to Monte Carlo: the Analytical Model\nAs an alternative, we developed an analytical model for Microsoft Excel that offered a much faster run time than the full Monte Carlo simulation. The sheet has two tabs of inputs: constant parameters (first tab, static), and case counts (second tab, dynamic).\nThe analytical model had the same idea as the Monte Carlo simulation. Some fraction of individuals who test positive today will be hospitalized after a varying offset (from test date to admit date) and variable duration (from admit date to discharge date) based on their characteristics (see appendix). Because these parameters can vary by region, anyone can change these values in spreadsheet tab 1.\nThe characteristics are:\n\nAge Group: (Most important) [unspecified, 0-9, 10-19, 20-29 … 70-79, 80+]\nSex: [unspecified, M, F]\nRace: [unspecified, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian]\n\nAnd the parameters are:\n\nHospitalization Rate\nOffset Distribution Parameter Set: Parameters describing the number of days before someone who tests positive is hospitalized\nDuration Distribution Parameter Set: Parameters describing the number of days someone will be in the hospital\n\nThe second types of inputs are the daily positive cases split by their traits. This is the input that the user actively changes on their end.\nBehind the scenes, we take these parameters (first input tab) and generate Offset Fractions, which is the probability that a patient with given traits will occupy a bed for a duration k days after the specimen testing date. These Offset Fractions and the daily positive case breakdown (second input) give us the expected mean and variance up to 1 month in the future of the number of patients in the hospital per day based on the cases already seen (for details, see appendix). This information can be used to generate plots like (Fig. 3). This graph isn’t to suggest that there won’t be any need for beds after February! It is just that based on the cases we know, very few people will be hospitalized for more than a month.\n\n\nFig. 3:  Output of Cases2Beds using historical data until January 21st for Allegheny County Using Public Parameters\nIf we assume independence between patients, the mean and variance calculations are exact. However, our quantile estimates are based on approximating the sum of independent binary variables, which is inaccurate near the tails. So the accuracy of the more extreme quantiles (95%+) depends on the number of cases present, which in practice makes them less trustworthy.\nCases2Beds in Action\nBy the end of November 2020, we had a viable prototype Cases2Beds spreadsheet used by ACHD. Over the following months, we made various modifications with their feedback. For example, the ACHD staff did not have time to manually input case numbers. So, we were able to use the granular public data to give them estimates of future hospital utilization without any additional work on their end.\nAt the peak of bed utilization, hospital systems themselves increased their COVID beds utilization to 6x more than in October 2020. Fortunately, in Allegheny County, we never reached a point where demand for beds exceeded a somewhat elastic supply. In early January 2021, multiple organizations told us that the pandemic’s most acute problem had changed to vaccine distribution and the number of COVID-19 beds needed dropped. Cases2Beds continues to act as an early warning system if the number of cases rise quickly.\n\n\nFig. 4: Numbers of staffed COVID beds over time vs. capacity from the HHS Protect Data 5.\nWe were also able to show the efficacy of the spreadsheet to other health departments and hospitals by generating tailored, public parameters for offset and length of stay from different national public resources, like the Florida line-level COVID dataset 4.\nBased on these organizations’ feedback that they needed projections more than 2 weeks out, we started to use Cases2Beds as an input to hospital utilization forecasting models. Other inputs to the hospital forecasting model included current hospital bed utilization  (from HHS Protect5), how long current patients are likely to continue to be hospitalized, and how many new cases there will be in the near future. A preliminary evaluation of such a method shows decent predictive power when parameters are tailored to a location.\nConclusion\nCases2Beds was a case study about the realities of research institutions offering actionable intelligence in healthcare. While the Cases2Beds tool demonstrated reasonable predictive power, it was difficult to deploy it in a timely and actionable way. Our most significant challenges were data access and bureaucratic limitations to develop solutions at the granularity needed.\nResearch institutions can be effective partners to health organizations, but the next set of challenges of this pandemic–or the next–will require quick action. The tools we build now can set the stage for the future.\nThank you to the Allegheny County Health Department (especially Antony Gnalian, Dr. LuAnn Brink, and Dr. Debra Bogen) for their invaluable feedback, efforts, and shared interest in actionable intelligence.\nMany members of the Delphi Group, including Sumit Agrawal, Katie Mazaitis, and Phil McGuinness, met regularly with the Allegheny County Health Department, provided data, edited this blog post, and investigated various solutions other than Cases2Beds.\nResources\nPlease check out the Cases2Beds Github Repo\n1.

For a given set of traits, the Offset Fractions for day k, where k is between -10 and 31, is the sum of the offset * distribution probabilities * hospitalization rate that sum up to day k.

Neither of these flash caches can efficiently support tiny objects\nbecause, as explained further below, log-structured caches require prohibitively large\nDRAM overheads whereas set-associative caches require prohibitively large write overheads.\nLog-structured caches: Too much DRAM\nLog-structured caches use flash as a circular log.\nDuring an insert, objects are first buffered in DRAM and then written to flash\nsequentially in large groups.\nSince objects can end up anywhere on flash, the cache maintains an in-memory index to find objects.\nThe advantage of a log-structured design is that it has a low write amplification.\nWrite amplification is the number of bytes written to flash divided by\nthe cumulative object size, and it represents the write overhead of a cache.\nA write amplification of one is optimal, though often it is higher.\nFor example, writing a 100-byte object to flash by itself has a write amplification\nof ~40x since flash has a minimum write granularity of 4KB.\nFlash has a limited number of times it can be rewritten before becoming unusable.\nTherefore, this significant write amplification wears out the flash device quickly,\nrequiring the device to be replaced quickly.\nSince a log-structured cache buffers objects in DRAM,\nit can wait until it has enough objects to write them to flash efficiently.\nThus, log-structured caches have close-to-optimal write amplification.\nHowever, log-structured caches have a large DRAM overhead when caching tiny objects.\nThey have to keep an index entry for every on-flash object to enable\nfinding those objects again on a lookup request.\nSince objects are around 100 bytes, there would be roughly 20 billion of them\nin a 2 TB flash cache.\nEven with the lowest overhead in the literature at 30 bits/object,\nthe cache would require 75 GB just to the index objects on flash.\nSince caching on flash is meant to lower costs through removing DRAM,\nlog-structured caches are inefficient for tiny objects because they require too much DRAM.\nSet-associative caches: Too many writes\nMeanwhile, set-associative caches use flash as a large hash table where each flash page is a single set, or hash bucket.\nDuring a lookup request, the cache hashes an object’s key to find it’s potential set on\nflash and reads that flash page to find the object.\nSince the finding objects is based on a hash function, set-associative caches\ndo not need large amounts of memory to track objects.\nThus, unlike log-structured caches, set-associative caches have a low\nenough memory overhead to support large flash caches.\nHowever, these caches write many more bytes than necessary.\nWhen inserting a new object, the cache has to write, at a minimum,\na 4 KB flash page for every object.\nIf objects are roughly 100 bytes, the cache has a 40x write amplification.\nThus, set-associative caches are also inefficient for tiny objects because they\nrequire too many writes.\nKangaroo: An efficient tiny-object flash cache\nKangaroo caches tiny objects on flash effectively by combining log-structured and set-associative caches to reduce both DRAM and flash-write overheads.\nKangaroo has two main parts: KLog, a small log-structured flash cache, and KSet, a large set-associative flash cache.\nAt a high level, Kangaroo uses KLog as a staging area for objects so that\nwriting them to KSet is more efficient.\nFinding objects in Kangaroo\n\n\nOn a lookup, Kangaroo looks for the object in (1) the DRAM cache, then (2a) KLog’s index and (2b) KLog if the key is in the index, then finally (3a) KSet’s\nBloom filters and (3b) KSet if the Bloom filters indicate the object could be there.\nIf the object is not found in any of these locations, Kangaroo returns a miss.\n\nInserting objects in Kangaroo\n\n\nOn an insert, Kangaroo first places the object in (1) the DRAM cache.\nThis insertion may evict an object from the DRAM cache.\nIf the object is not admitted to flash, (2a) it is evicted from Kangaroo.\nFor instance, objects can be evicted at this stage based on a random admission policy,\nwhere each object has a fixed probability of admission to the flash cache.\nOtherwise, it is inserted into (2b) KLog’s index and (2c) written to flash in KLog via a buffered write.\nWhen objects are evicted from KLog, they are again subject to an admission policy,\ndescribed more in the next section,\nand (3a) can be evicted from Kangaroo entirely.\nAdmitted objects are written to (3b) KSet along with any other objects in KLog\nthat map to the same set in KSet.\n\nOne important aspect of the insertion path in Kangaroo that reduces write amplification\nis how Kangaroo moves objects from KLog to KSet.\nKLog often contains multiple objects mapping to the same set in KSet,\nsuch as the pink and yellow objects in the figure above.\nWhenever an object is evicted from KLog, Kangaroo proactively uses KLog’s index to\nfind any other objects that map to the same set in KSet,\nand moves them to KLog as well.\nSince writing a set always requires writing 4 KB, regardless of the number of objects inserted, writing multiple new objects instead of just 1 greatly reduces the the write amplification.\nThus, Kangaroo amortizes writes to KSet over multiple objects, decreasing the overall number of bytes written to flash.\nKangaroo accomplishes this amortization with a small KLog (~5% of flash), resulting in only a small DRAM overhead to index KLog’s entire capacity.\nKangaroo thus addresses both the DRAM and flash-write overheads of caching tiny objects on flash.\nKangaroo optimizations\nOn top of this basic design, Kangaroo introduces additional techniques to increase its effectiveness.\nIn particular, since Kangaroo is a cache and not a key-value store, it can evict objects to minimize writes.\nKangaroo exploits this opportunity by adding a threshold admission policy that evicts objects from KLog instead of admitting them to KSet if there are fewer than n objects to insert to a set in KSet.\nThis admission policy allows Kangaroo to guarantee that the write amplification for moving objects to KSet will be much lower than a set-associative cache.\nKangaroo also introduces RRIParoo, a low DRAM-overhead eviction policy for KSet\nbased on the processor eviction policy RRIP.\nAt a high level, RRIParoo keeps one bit in DRAM per object in KSet\nto represent whether an object has been requested since the object was last\nwritten to flash.\nWhen a set is rewritten, this bit is used to update a 3-bit recency values kept on flash per object.\nObjects in a set are then ordered by their 3-bit recency value\nand Kangaroo evicts the least valuable\nobjects to make room for objects coming from KLog.\nThus, RRIParoo allows an advanced eviction policy in KSet\nwhile keeping a low DRAM overhead.\nKangaroo provides further optimizations to reduce DRAM overhead and reduce misses, as explained in our SOSP’21 paper.\nTogether, these optimizations allow Kangaroo to overcome the limitations of log-structured caches and set-associative caches,\ncreating a flash cache that delivers on the goal of efficient caching for tiny objects.\nKangaroo outperforms other flash caches\nWe evaluated Kangaroo on a 2 TB flash drive using a production trace from Facebook\nunder production DRAM and write rate constraints.\nWe also evaluated CacheLib’s default small object cache (SA), a set-assocative\ncache that Facebook uses to serve its social graph,\nand an optimistic version of a log-structured cache (LS) with a full in-DRAM\nindex.\n\n\nKangaroo reduces misses compared to LS by 56% and to SA by 29% over the last\n2 days of the production FB trace.\nLS’s high DRAM overhead means that it cannot index the entire flash drive.\nThus, it has a lower effective capacity, which increases its miss ratio.\nSA’s high write amplification means that it has to rate limit its insertions\nand greatly over-provision flash to prevent the flash device from\nwearing out too quickly.\nKangaroo does not run into these issues and has a better eviction policy,\nallowing it to outperform other flash caches.\n\nWe corroborated these results in a production shadow deployment at Facebook.\nIn addition, Kangaroo maintains its advantage if operated under different constraints,\nsuch as different write rate limits, more or less available DRAM, different tiny object workload, and larger device capacities. More details on these results can be found in our paper.\nConclusion\nKangaroo is a flash cache for billions of tiny objects that handles a wide range of DRAM and flash-write budgets.\nKangaroo leverages prior log-structured and set-associative designs, together with new techniques, to achieve the best of both designs.\nExperiments using a trace from Facebook show DRAM usage close to the best prior DRAM- optimized design,\nflash writes close to the best prior write-optimized design,\nand miss ratios better than either.\nKangaroo shows that flash caches can support tiny objects,\nan adversarial workload for DRAM usage and write amplification,\nwhile maintaining flash’s cost advantage.\nFor more details about Kangaroo, check out our SOSP presentation and paper.\nAcknowledgments\nI want to thank my other collaborators on this work:\nBenjamin Berg (CMU), Julian Tutuncu-Macias (CMU, now at Goldman Sachs), Juncheng Yang (CMU), Sathya Gunasekar (Facebook), Jimmy Lu (Facebook),\nDaniel Berger (Microsoft Research and University of Washington), Nathan Beckmann (CMU), and Greg Ganger (CMU).\nI would also like to give a special thanks to the CacheLib team at Facebook\nas well as both Facebook and Twitter for sharing traces with us.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2022/kangaroo/","title":"Kangaroo: Caching billions of tiny objects on flash"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2022/timetraveling-simulation/":{"body":"Blockchains are a powerful technology which allow decentralized agreement with an immutable history. Since transactions can be added, but not removed, blockchains allow distributed banking as a trustworthy alternative to central banking.\nA vast amount of cryptographic research on constructing secure blockchains has led to them being trusted to secure currency worth hundreds of billions of US dollars.\nRecently, blockchains have received attention as an enabler of cryptography rather than just a goal of it. Several works have used blockchains to build a variety of cryptographic tools, including one-time programs and time-lock encryption. These tools are impossible to construct without special assumptions. These works model cryptographic protocols as occurring in a world where a blockchain protocol is being executed. The cryptographic protocol is therefore able to perform actions such as reading the state of the blockchain or posting transactions to it. The exact security definitions vary significantly between these approaches.\nTime-traveling simulation is a new security model for protocols executed in the presence of a blockchain. Intuitively, time-traveling simulation captures the philosophy that “any extra information an adversary learns in a real execution could have been learned on their own by waiting for the natural passage of time”. Since a blockchain will naturally progress no matter what the adversary does, it provides the notion of time needed to formalize this philosophy.\nTime-traveling simulation bypasses many impossibility results, while the same time yielding an arguably stronger notion of security than prior blockchain based works. For example, time-traveling simulation enables zero knowledge arguments and secure two-party computation in three messages. It is currently not known how to construct these protocols in three messages with the standard notion of security, without relying on new hardness assumptions.\nIn this article, we will dive into the definition of time-traveling simulation and how it compares to other security notions. Additionally, we will explore how it can be used to bypass impossibility results for three message zero knowledge arguments.\nThe Philosophy of Security\nIn modern cryptography, the central philosophy for security is “any extra information an adversary learns in a real execution could have been learned on their own”. In other words, the adversary learns nothing from participating in the real execution, beyond what they were supposed to learn. For example, in a zero knowledge argument, the adversary only learns that a given NP statement is true, without learning a witness for why it is true. This particular notion is actually too strong for many applications, so cryptographers usually consider weakenings of this philosophy with the same spirit. The most common weakening is “any extra information an adversary learns in a real execution could have been learned on their own using a little extra computation”.\nThese philosophies are captured formally by a mathematical object called a simulator. A simulator’s job is to reproduce whatever knowledge the adversarial verifier would have learned in a real execution of the protocol. However, it must do this without access to the real prover; it only has the adversary’s code. If such a simulator exists, then the adversary could run the simulator on its own. By doing so, it learns everything it would have learned in a real interaction, without interacting with the real prover.\nMore formally, a simulator (for zero knowledge) takes as input the adversary’s code and the statement being proven, then outputs a transcript of a protocol execution, along with the adversary’s internal state. In the real world, without loss of generality, the adversary outputs the transcript of the protocol execution along with its own internal state. This is before any post-processing. A protocol is zero knowledge if there exists a simulator whose output distribution is indistinguishable from the output distribution of the adversary in the real world. This guarantees that whatever information can be derived from the output of the adversary in the real world is indistinguishable from what can be derived from the simulator. Thus, by running the simulator, the adversary can learn whatever it would have learned in a real execution.\n\nFigure: The simulator imagines an interaction between the adversarial verifier and an imaginary prover. This interaction is indistinguishable from a real interaction, from the adversary's point of view.\nIn some sense, a simulator can be viewed as a method for the adversary to fool itself into accepting the truth of a statement without knowing a witness. It is important that the adversary can only fool itself - an adversarial prover should not be able to fool an honest verifier. This requires some asymmetry between the simulator and a real-world adversary. One of the most basic forms of asymmetry is knowledge of the adversary’s code, which allows the simulator to internally run and interact with the adversary. Any adversary knows its own code, but it certainly shouldn’t know anyone else’s!\nTo relax the security philosophy, the simulator is provided with some form of additional power which represents additional asymmetry between the simulator and a real-world adversary. The more asymmetry, the easier it is to create a simulator without allowing an adversarial prover to convince an honest verifier of a false statement. In general, providing more extra power to the simulator corresponds to a weaker security notion. The adversary can learn whatever the simulator can learn, so a more powerful simulator corresponds to an adversary which can learn more information. The table below compares common relaxations to time-traveling simulation in terms of their philosophies and what extra power is given to the simulator.\nSecurity NotionPhilosophy: “Any extra information an adversary learns in a real execution could have been learned on their own…”Simulator\nExpected PPT (Standard)in expected PPT.Runs in expected poly time.\nSuperpolynomial Simulationin superpolynomial time.Runs in superpolynomial time.\nCommon Reference String (CRS)using the CRS trapdoor.Can choose the CRS used by both parties. This allows adding a trapdoor to it.\nMajority Simulationif they controlled the blockchain.Controls the majority of blockchain participants.\nTime-Traveling Simulationshortly into the future.Can look into the future.\n\nSecurity Implications of Time-Traveling Simulation\nAs mentioned previously, time-traveling simulation captures the philosophy that “any extra information an adversary learns in a real execution could have been learned on their own by waiting for the natural passage of time”. This is realized by allowing the simulator to see a potential future state of the blockchain, which consists of a valid extension by \\( F \\) blocks. Since such a state will become public information after a short time regardless of what the adversary does, this only reveals information that would have anyway been revealed with the natural passage of time.\nSimulator access to a future state allows time-traveling simulation to bypass impossibility results for expected probabilistic polynomial time simulation, which is considered the standard notion of simulation.\nA common blockchain property is that a computationally-bounded adversary cannot compute a valid extension by \\( F \\) blocks faster than the honest parties can extend the chain by, say, \\( \\sqrt{F} \\) blocks. Therefore access to a future state represents additional asymmetry between the simulator and a real adversary.\nThis additional asymmetry makes it possible for the simulator to “imagine” the adversary’s real-world view in protocols where it otherwise would not have been able to, bypassing the impossibility results for expected PPT simulation (aka standard simulation).\n\nFigure: A blockchain comes equipped with a validity predicate which allows checking whether a state is a valid extension of a previous state. A future state is a valid extension of the current state.\nTime-traveling simulation is almost as meaningful as standard simulation when it comes to long-term knowledge.\nFor example, imagine the task of constructing multi-party computation protocols which are secure against malicious adversaries. A malicious adversary may deviate from the protocol arbitrarily. Another kind of adversary is a semi-honest adversary, which follows the protocol, but may attempt to analyze the transcript later. It is much easier to construct multi-party computation protocols which are secure against semi-honest adversaries. A multi-party computation protocol with semi-honest security can be transformed to have malicious security by using the GMW compiler. To do the transformation, each party proves the statement “I executed the protocol honestly using some input” in zero knowledge. This convinces the other parties that they did indeed behave honestly, but does not reveal an explanation for the honest behavior. Crucially, this means that the zero knowledge argument preserves the privacy of each party’s inputs. Now consider using a zero knowledge argument with time-traveling simulation to instantiate the GMW compiler. Since honest behavior in a non-time-sensitive protocol does not depend on the passage of time, this does not reveal an explanation for the honest behavior. In particular, the inputs of each party are still private.\nIn contrast, time-traveling simulation may not be suitable for applications which are inherently time sensitive. For example, consider using a zero knowledge argument with time-traveling simulation to prove knowledge of a solution to a time-lock puzzle. A time-lock puzzle can be solved in some set amount of time (for example, a day), but cannot be solved faster than that. Since the simulator has access to a future state from after the time-lock puzzle can be solved, in this situation time-traveling simulation may allow the solution to be leaked today instead of tomorrow.\nComparison to Other Relaxed Security Notions\nSeveral of these security notions also bypass impossibility results for expected PPT simulation. One way to further compare security notions is comparing how powerful their simulators are. As mentioned previously, a security notion which allows the simulator more power may allow the adversary to learn more information. In many cases, time-traveling simulation gives the simulator less power than other simulation notions, so it corresponds to better security guarantees.\nSuper-Polynomial Time Simulation. Time-traveling simulation can be seen as a very restricted form of super-polynomial time or angel-based simulation. Angel-based simulation is similar to super-polynomial time simulation, but restricts the extra computational power to performing one specific task. For example, an angel may break the security of a particular commitment scheme. Both super-polynomial time and angel-based simulators are very powerful and can bypass many impossibility results. However, it can be challenging to argue that the simulator cannot break the security of other primitives. These primitives may only have security against polynomial-time adversaries, so they can be broken using any super-polynomial time computation. Continuing the example of commitments, if the simulator could also break a second commitment scheme, then it cannot guarantee that the second scheme is secure against the real adversary.\nIn the case of time-traveling simulation, the angel’s task is to quickly compute a potential future state of the blockchain exactly once. It is worth emphasizing the special nature of this task: it is computing something which will be publicly available information in just a short while. As such, whatever security a time-traveling simulator breaks would have been broken soon anyway. For example, regardless of which commitment scheme the parties use, the commitment to their input can never be broken by a time-traveling simulator.\nCommon Reference String. Another good point of comparison is the common reference string model, since the blockchain state represents a pre-agreed-upon string. One important difference between a CRS and the way time-traveling simulation uses a blockchain is that the format of a common reference string often depends on the exact protocol being run (for example, a zero knowledge proof or a secure computation protocol). However, a blockchain does not adapt to auxiliary protocols. A second, and perhaps more important difference, is the notion of control. In the CRS model, the simulator has full control over the CRS. A time-traveling simulator, on the other hand, has no actual control over the blockchain, only some extra information about it. This means that a time-traveling simulator can learn less information than a simulator with full control over the blockchain. Since an adversary might be able to learn whatever a simulator can, the security notion is stronger if the simulator only has extra information, instead of full control.\nMajority Simulation. This difference in control over versus knowledge about the blockchain is especially illustrated when comparing time-traveling simulation to majority simulation. Majority simulation is another relaxed security model for protocols executed alongside a blockchain. In majority simulation, the simulator is allowed control over all honest parties which are participating in the progression of the blockchain. Since blockchain security requires the honest parties to be in control of the blockchain, this allows a majority simulator to perform tasks such as pausing or even rewinding the blockchain. Such capabilities should even allow computation of future states of the blockchain, which is the only power given to a time-traveling simulator.\nIn particular, majority simulation can introduce security vulnerabilities when running two different protocols using the same blockchain. Since the two protocols rely on the security of the blockchain, a simulator with full control over the blockchain can easily break the security of either protocol. Therefore majority simulation does not guarantee that a party which participates in one protocol cannot violate the security of the other protocol. Although it is nontrivial to see, time-traveling simulation can allow multiple protocols to use the same blockchain at the same time if they are careful.\nApplication: Time-Traveling Simulators for Zero Knowledge\nTime-traveling simulators allow a particularly simple construction for zero knowledge arguments with three messages. As mentioned previously, constructing zero knowledge arguments with three messages is very difficult under the standard notion of security (expected PPT simulation). Prior work shows that any security proof for a three message zero knowledge argument must make non-blackbox use of the adversary’s code. However, non-blackbox techniques are notoriously difficult. The only current construction for three message zero knowledge relies on new cryptographic hardness assumptions.\nA zero knowledge argument is, first and foremost, an argument. A prover attempts to convince a verifier that an NP statement \\( x\\) is in an NP language \\( L\\). The prover should not be able to convince the verifier of a false statement; this property is called soundness. The zero knowledge property requires that the argument does allow the verifier to learn anything about the witness for \\( x \\in L\\). This is formalized using the simulator definition discussed above. As a reminder, the simulator must approximate a real view of the argument, except it does not have access to the real prover. In the standard notion of simulation, the simulator is an expected PPT algorithm.\nIn time-traveling simulation for zero knowledge arguments, the simulator additionally receives a valid extension of the blockchain by \\(F\\) blocks. Then it must produce the adversary’s view. If left alone, the blockchain will generate extensions of itself which are independent of the statement \\(x\\) or its witnesses. Therefore the future state which the simulator receives is effectively harmless and contains no information about the witness beyond what is naturally leaked with the passage of time.\n\nFigure: In a real zero knowledge argument execution, the prover knows the witness. A time-traveling simulator for zero knowledge receives a future state of the blockchain instead of the witness.\nZero Knowledge in Three Rounds\nThe construction of a three round zero knowledge argument uses a three round witness indistinguishable proof of knowledge (WIPoK). In a WIPoK, a prover convinces a verifier that they “know” a witness for some NP statement. The witness indistinguishability property guarantees that if there are two possible witnesses for the statement, then the verifier cannot tell which one the prover knows. This is a weaker security guarantee than zero knowledge, so it is possible to construct a WIPoK in just three rounds (even without assuming special setup like a CRS or a blockchain).\nThe construction is as follows. To prove the truth of an NP statement \\( x\\), the prover and verifier engage in a WIPoK for the statement “I know a witness for \\( x\\) or I know a blockchain state \\(F\\) blocks ahead of the current state”. Showing zero knowledge requires constructing a time-traveling simulator, which is initialized with a future state. The simulator acts as a prover in the WIPoK with the adversary, using the future state as its witness. Witness indistinguishability guarantees that an execution using the future state as a witness is indistinguishable from an execution using a witness for \\(x \\). The latter case is exactly what occurs in a real execution, so the simulator’s output is indistinguishable from a real execution.\nTo show soundness, observe that any adversarial prover must know a witness for the statement. This is either a witness for \\( x \\) or it is a future state of the blockchain. Since a real adversary cannot possibly know a future state of the blockchain without violating the blockchain’s security, it must know a witness for \\( x\\). The full argument for soundness requires some additional care in order to use the proof of knowledge property, since the WIPoK is composed in parallel with a blockchain protocol and many security properties break down during parallel composition.

However, HDDs are limited to ~100 IOs per second. Thus, modern storage systems in datacenters widely rely on flash caches to absorb backend load and reduce the number of HDDs required to satisfy the IO workload.\nWhile flash has orders of magnitude higher IOPS, it suffers from wearout as it is written to.\nFlash drives lifetime projections assume relatively low average write rates such as “three drive-writes per day (DWPD)”, meaning 3N TB of writes to a N TB flash drive each day. Flash drives with even lower write endurance (e.g., 1 DWPD) are priced correspondingly lower. Given that traditional cache management policies designed for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) can incur writes exceeding 100 DWPD, there is a need for smart flash admission policies to filter the right items to be written into cache.\nMachine learning (ML) policies have been proposed to improve upon historically popular policies, which include random admission and history-based policies that reject items without sufficient recent usage. However, caching is a challenging problem for ML to get right[3]. Furthermore, systems practitioners desire that policies also be understandable in addition to being performant[4].\nWe decompose the flash caching problem into admission, prefetching, and eviction. This helps us align policy decisions to well-understood supervised ML techniques. We also co-design these components, as we show that a policy can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on other parts of the system.\nThe Baleen flash cache exploits a new cache residency model (which we call episodes) to improve ML training effectiveness. The episodes model also enables a new useful comparison point (OPT). Baleen focuses on optimizing for an end-to-end metric (HDD disk-head time) that balances IOPS and bandwidth, rather than hit rate. We find that a combination of ML-guided admission and ML-guided prefetching works best in reducing peak backend load.\nBaleen reduces HDD peak load by 11.8% over state-of-the-art policies on seven recent real-world storage cluster traces collected over 3 years. This work is under submission.\nBackground: Bulk storage systems\nBulk storage systems are relied on by hyperscalars to aggregate persistent\nstorage needs in data centers including blob storage and data warehouses\n(such as HDFS[7]). Users might not\neven know they are using one, as such systems function quietly behind the scenes\nat cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and\nMicrosoft Azure. In this paper, we use Meta’s Tectonic[2] as an important\nand representative example of a bulk storage system. Many other systems have a\nsimilar design (e.g., Google’s Colossus[4][5], YouTube[6]). In Tectonic, as in other systems[5][6], flash caches are used to reduce load on the backing HDDs and meet throughput requirements.\nAccesses are made to byte ranges within blocks. Blocks are mapped to a location on backing HDDs, and subdivided into many smaller units called segments that can be individually cached (Tectonic has 8 MB blocks and 128 KB segments). Upon an access, the cache is checked for all segments needed to cover the request byte range. If any are missing, an IO is made to the backing store to fetch them, at which point they can be admitted into the cache.\nThe storage system has 10,000s of storage nodes independently serving requests. The ratio of backing HDD space : flash cache : DRAM cache is 37,800 : 40 : 1. We focus on the scope of an individual node.\nBulk storage limited by disk-head time\nAt scale, hard disks (HDDs) remain the choice of backing store as they are cheaper by an order of magnitude per GB than SSDs[8]. Newer HDDs offer increased storage density, resulting in shrinking IO capacity (IOPS and bandwidth) per GB as more GBs are served by the same disk head.\n\nFig 1: Disk-head Time consists of a seek &amp; transfer time. This reflects disk-head times on our testbed.\nDisk-head time on backing HDDs is a premium resource. The mechanical nature of HDDs results in a high, size-independent access time penalty (e.g., 10 ms) for positioning the read/write head. With a high read rate (e.g., 5.5 ms per MB) and a maximum block size of 8 MB, a request could take 10 to 70 ms. In provisioning bulk storage, peak demand for disk-head time matters most.  If the system has insufficient IO capacity, requests queue up, and slowdowns occur. If sustained, clients retry requests and failures occur, affecting user experience. Thus, bulk storage IO requirements are defined by peak load, which in turn affects storage costs.\nFlash caches absorb backend load but have limited write endurance\nFlash caching plays an important role in absorbing backend load, compensating for disk-head time limitations of the underlying HDDs. This setup enables resource-efficient storage for workloads that exceed the throughput requirements of HDDs but which are infeasible to store using flash alone. With the trends towards higher density HDDs and fewer bytes per HDD spindle, flash caches unlock more usable bytes per spindle.\nFlash does not have access setup penalties, but does have wearout that translates into long-term average-write-rate limits. SSD manufacturers rate their drives’ endurance in terms of drive-writes per day (DWPD) over their warranty period.\nCaching is an especially challenging workload for flash, since items will have widely varying lifetimes, resulting in a usage pattern closer to random I/Os than large sequential writes. Items admitted together may not be evicted at the same time, worsening write amplification. Writing every miss into flash would cause it to wear out prematurely.\nFlash caches leverage admission policies (APs) to decide if items should be inserted into the flash cache or discarded, and have simple eviction policies (Least Recently Used, First-In First-Out) to minimize write amplification[1]. Like eviction policies, admission policies weigh the benefit of hits from new items against lost hits from evicted items. They must also weigh the write cost of admitting the new item against other past or future items. Policies have an admission threshold that can be varied to achieve the target flash write rate. We provide some examples.\n\nCoinFlip (baseline) On a miss, segments for an access are either all admitted, or not at all, with probability 𝑝. This simple policy does not need tracking of past items seen.\nRejectX (baseline) rejects a segment the first X times it is seen. Past accesses are tracked using probabilistic data structures similar to Bloom filters. We use X = 1 and vary the window size of past accesses to achieve the desired write rate. Both Meta [1] and Google [4] used this prior to switching to more complex policies.\nML admission policies use offline features to make decisions in addition to online features such as past access counts. A ML model can be trained offline based on a trace (as we do), or online using reinforcement learning.\n\nBaleen Design\nOptimize for Disk-head time, not hits or bandwidth\nWe propose that backing store load be measured using disk-head time (DT), which is a throughput metric that balances IOPS and bandwidth.\nDefinition: Disk-Head Time (DT) is the cost of serving a single request to the backend. For a single IO that fetches n bytes:\n$$ DT(n) = SeekTime + TransferTime * n $$\nPolicies are then assessed in terms of Disk-Head Time saved, rather than\nobject-level hits (corresponding to IOPS) or byte-level hits (corresponding to\nbandwidth). Disk-Head Time can also be seen as a weighted sum of object-level\nhits and byte-level hits.\nWe use Disk-Head Time to score episodes for OPT (our approximate optimal online\nadmission policy) and ultimately generate labels for training Baleen’s ML\nadmission policy. In training Baleen’s prefetcher, we use Disk-Head Time to\nassess the benefit of prefetching for a particular episode.\nSystem capacity, such as the number of backend servers, is provisioned to handle peak load in systems that need to meet realtime demand. Therefore, to reduce the backend size, one should minimize peak disk-head time. This introduces the need for scheduling (i.e., when to spend the flash write rate budget) to prioritize the admission of items that contribute to peak disk-head time. As explicitly optimizing for the peak introduces significant complexity, we leave that for future work. For Baleen, we design our methods to minimize average disk-head time, but show that they are successful in reducing peak disk-head time as well.\nDecomposing caching into admission, prefetching and eviction\nWe define the caching problem as determining which times we should fetch, admit and evict each segment in order to minimize the backend’s DT given a flash write rate limit.\nWe propose a heuristic decomposition of this problem into three sub-problems: admission, prefetching, and eviction. This makes it easier to reason about the optimal solutions to each sub-problem and the training and behavior of ML solutions for each part.\nAdmission: Whether to admit something into cache in anticipation of future hits that reduce disk-head time. We trade off the disk-head time saved against the write rate used from caching an item. We model admission as a binary classifier, where misses are admitted if the outout probability exceeds the policy threshold.\nPrefetching: Whether to prefetch extra segments outside the current access range (which was a miss). We trade off disk-head time saved from hits on the first accesses against the additional time spent in cache, and for incorrect prefetches, the disk-head time wasted and the opportunity cost of the wasted flash write rate. We further decompose the prefetching problem into a) deciding what segments to prefetch and b) when to prefetch (whether the expected benefit exceeds the cost, taking into account the possibility of mispredictions)\nEviction: Which segment in the cache to pick for eviction upon an admission. One can employ existing approaches for non-flash caches, including ML-based policies. We employ a simple eviction policy (in our case, Least Recently Used) as is used in production systems, leaving ML-based flash-aware eviction policies for future work.\nIntroducing episodes: an offline model for flash caching\nWe devised an offline model for flash caching for efficient evaluation of flash caching improvements, and to facilitate the training of ML-based policies. This model revolves around episodes, which are defined as:\nDefinition An episode is a sequence of accesses that would be hits (apart from the first access) if the corresponding item was admitted. It is defined on a block, and may span multiple segments. As shown in Fig 2, an episode’s size is the number of segments needed to cache it, and its timespan is the length of time between the first access of any segment and the last eviction of a segment.\n\nFig 2: Episodes span space (measured in segments) in addition to time. An episode’s size is the smallest number of segments required to be admitted to get all possible hits within an episode. OPT-Range is (1,3) and (2,3) respectively.\n\nFig 3: An episode is a group of accesses corresponding to a block’s residency. Accesses (in blue) are grouped into two episodes as the interarrival time (in red) exceeds the assumed eviction age.\nWe generate episodes by exploiting the model of a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache as evicting items a constant logical time (eviction age) after the last access. In a LRU cache, the eviction age is the logical time between an item’s last access &amp; eviction. As shown in Fig 3, we group accesses into episodes such that all inter-arrival times within episodes are no larger than the assumed eviction age.\nEpisodes provide a direct mapping to the costs and benefits associated with an admission, and which corresponds directly to the decisions actually being made by admission policies. These benefits and costs are associated with a item’s entire lifespan in cache, and are not obvious from looking at a stream of individual accesses. Moreover, with flash caching, it is optimal to admit as early as possible in the episode, given that the flash writes required are a fixed cost. By shifting the mental model from interdependent accesses to independent episodes, we can reason about decisions more easily.\nDecisions on episodes can be made independent by assuming a constant eviction age. This also allows decisions to be made in parallel. The added pressure on cache space via an admission is accounted for via downwards pressure on the eviction age. We determine an appropriate eviction age using simulations that measure the average eviction age.\nThe episode model also allows for an efficient offline analytical analysis of policies via Little’s Law. Given the arrival rate and assumed eviction age, we can estimate the cache size required, and set eviction age such that the analytical cache size is equal to the cache size constraint. While this is much more efficient than an online simulation and is useful to explore a greater range of parameters than is possible with online simulation, the numbers will differ from simulated ones as the cache size constraint is not enforced all the time, only as a long-term average.\nAdmission policies can be viewed as partitioning these episodes into those admitted and discarded. This can be done via scoring episodes and ranking them by score.\nBaleen System Architecture\n\nFig 4: Baleen System Architecture.\nWe describe Baleen’s architecture in terms of what happens at training time and when deployed with a CacheLib[[1] implementation. At training time, episodes are generated and used to train Baleen’s ML admission and ML prefetching policies. At deployment time, the trained models are supplied to CacheLib which uses them to make decisions on the fly.\nOPT approximates optimal online admission policy\nWe devise an online admission policy, OPT, that we train Baleen’s ML policy to imitate. In OPT, first, each block’s accesses are grouped into episodes using an assumed eviction age. Second, all episodes are scored using the equation below and sorted. Last, the maximum number of episodes are admitted such that the total flash writes required do not exceed the write rate budget. During online simulation, accesses will be admitted if they belong to episodes that were marked as admitted during the offline process.\n$$ Score(Episode)= \\frac{DTSaved(Episode)}{Size(Episode)} $$\nTraining Baleen to imitate OPT\nWe use OPT’s decisions as binary labels for training Baleen. Training examples are added for the first k (k = 6) accesses of each episode (to avoid biasing the training set towards popular but easy episodes). Features include offline metadata provided by the bulk storage system (which help identify which application the request originates from) and online history-based counts (how many hits the object has received in the last 1,2,3,4,5,6 hours).\nTraining Baleen to predict what and when to prefetch\nBy default, on a miss, the smallest IO that covers all missed segments is made, i.e., no prefetching occurs. It is possible to extend this IO and preemptively admit more segments. If done correctly, this reduces the total no of IOs needed and thus reduces Disk-head Time.\nBaleen has two prefetching models: ML-Range, and ML-When.\nLearning what to prefetch: ML-Range learns from OPT-Range\nOPT-Range is the minimal range of segments that will cover all accesses in an episode. Using the episodes model, we generate OPT-Range for each episode and use these as labels for ML-Range.\nML-Range is a ML model that predicts a range of segments for prefetching. We use the same features as the ML admission model, but add size-related features (access start index, access end index, access size). We train two regression models to predict the episode range start and end. Each episode is represented once in the training data, with only episodes that meet the score cutoff for the target write rate included\nLearning when to prefetch: ML-When\nFetching insufficient segments results in minimal or no Disk-head Time reduction. On the other hand, fetching excess segments results in a high write rate. To balance these tradeoffs, we need to know our confidence in our range prediction.\nMispredictions by the ML admission policy and in ML-Range can easily cause prefetching to hurt instead of help. In reality, the expected benefit will be lower than OPT prefetching and the cost can only be higher. The disk-head time saved from prefetching ML-Range may not be realized. Moreover, prefetching mispredictions are costly in terms of disk-head time consumed to fetch unused segments and the opportunity cost of flash writes used to store them. ML-When aims to address this and exclude epsiodes that do not have a high probability of benefiting from prefetching.\nThe exact equations are provided in our paper.\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate Baleen using a testbed and a simulator. We validate both with counters from production deployments. Each node in our testbed has a 400 GB flash drive and 2 4TB HDDs.\nWe report results on 7 Meta production traces collected in 2019, 2021 and 2023 and take an average across the traces.\nThese traces show week-long workloads on 7 Tectonic clusters from 3 different years,\nwith each cluster serving the storage needs of an entire data center[2].\nEach trace represents 7 days of production traffic from a single\ncluster (except for Region3, which has 3 days), with traffic sampled at every\nnode (each cluster has thousands of nodes) and later aggregated into a trace.\nThe Region1 and Region2 traces were recorded from different clusters over the same 7 days in Oct 2019, while the Region3 trace was recorded from another cluster over 3 days in Sep 2019. Region4 was recorded over 7 days in Oct 2021, and the remaining traces (Region5, Region6, Region7) were collected in Mar 2023.\n\nFig 5: Baleen reduces Peak Disk-head Time (DT) by an average of 11.8% over the best non-ML policy (RejectX), and 18.6% over random admission on 7 production traces from Meta under flash write rate constraints.\nFig 5 shows Baleen reduces Peak DT over RejectX by an average of 11.8% across all traces.\nIn our paper, we show this ranges from 4.8% to 22.6% across the 7 traces,\nwith 3 regions deriving most of their gains from prefetching.\n\n6a) Cache Sizes\n\n6b) Write Rates\nFig 6: Baleen continues to deliver improvements at higher cache sizes and write rates.\nFig 6 shows that the benefits of Baleen are consistent at higher cache sizes and write rates, with Baleen enabling a reduction in cache size by 55% while keeping\nthe same Peak DT as RejectX, or alternatively a reduction in Peak DT equivalent\nto a 4X increase in cache size. As expected, increasing write rate or cache size has diminishing returns in reducing Peak DT. Also, the different admission policies (without prefetching) start to converge, indicating that admission by itself is insufficient to drive further reductions in Peak DT. We provide graphs for all 7 traces in our\npaper.\nFurther results are available in our paper, such as:\n\nPrefetching should be selective and in tandem with admission\nWe show both ML-Range and ML-When are effective in reducing Peak DT over static baselines, and contribute to Baleen’s robustness across the multiple traces.\nWe also show that prefetching must be paired with a good admission policy; if not, the same prefetching policy can hurt rather than help.\nOptimizing the right metric: Peak DT We show how optimizing for IO\nhit ratio can be misleading, as doing so is optimal for reducing seeks, not\nDisk-head Time.\nValidation of simulator and testbed. We validated Baleen on our simulator\nagainst Baleen on our testbed. We took the additional step of showing that our\ntestbed is consistent with production counters.\nTrace analysis We show distributions for block popularity, interarrival times, access sizes and the compulsory miss trace, one-hit-wonder trace (fractions of blocks\nwith no reuse) and Admit-All flash write rate.\n\nIn our paper, we described a few lessons gleaned from 3 years of deploying ML\nin production caches at Meta. These lessons were that 1) optimizing the wrong metric is an easy misstep, 2) ML model performance does not always translate to production system performance, 3) to rethink the use of DRAM in flash caching, and that 4) ML-based caching should aim for encapsulation of ML, caching, and storage.\nTo read more, please see Section 6 (Lessons from deploying ML in production) of our paper.\nConclusion\nBaleen is a flash cache that uses ML to guide both prefetching and cache admission, reducing peak storage backend load on real workload traces from Meta. Baleen’s design arose from a number of false-step lessons and a cache residency (episodes) formulation that improves training effectiveness, provides an ideal (OPT) target, and exposed the particular value of ML-guided prefetching. As such, Baleen is an important step forward in flash caching for disk-based storage systems.\nMore details are available in our paper, which has been accepted to FAST 2024.

One challenge you’ll face is the actual collaboration: when one user changes the shared state, their changes need to show up for every other user. For example, if multiple users type at the same time in a text field, the result should reflect all of their changes and be consistent (identical for all users).\nConflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) provide a solution to this challenge. They are data structures that look like ordinary data structures (maps, sets, text strings, etc.), except that they are collaborative: when one user updates their copy of a CRDT, their changes automatically show up for everyone else. Each user sees their own changes immediately, while under the hood, the CRDT broadcasts a message describing the change to everyone else.  Other users see the change once they receive this message.\n\nNote that multiple users might make changes at the same time, e.g., both typing at once. Since each user sees their own changes immediately, their views of the document will temporarily diverge. However, CRDTs guarantee that once the users receive each others’ messages, they’ll see identical document states again: this is the definition of CRDT correctness. Ideally, this state will also be “reasonable”, i.e., it will incorporate both of their edits in the way that the users expect.\n\nIn distributed systems terms, CRDTs are Available, Partition tolerant, and have Strong Eventual Consistency.\n\n\nCRDTs work even if messages might be arbitrarily delayed, or delivered to different users in different orders. This lets you make collaborative experiences that don’t need a central server, work offline, and/or are end-to-end encrypted (local-first software).\n\nCRDTs allow offline editing, unlike Google Docs.\nI’m particularly excited by the potential for open-source collaborative apps that anyone can distribute or modify, without requiring app-specific hosting.\nThe Challenge: Designing CRDTs\nHaving read all that, let’s say you choose to use a CRDT for your collaborative app. All you need is a CRDT representing your app’s state, a frontend UI, and a network of your choice (or a way for users to pick the network themselves). But where do you get a CRDT for your specific app?\nIf you’re lucky, it’s described in a paper, or even better, implemented in a library. But those tend to have simple or one-size-fits-all data structures: maps, text strings, unstructured JSON, etc. You can usually rearrange your app’s state to make it fit in these CRDTs; and if users make changes at the same time, CRDT correctness guarantees that you’ll get some consistent result. However, it might not be what you or your users expect. Worse, you have little leeway to customize this behavior.\n\n\nIn a published JSON CRDT, when representing a todo-list using items with \"title\" and \"done\" fields, you can end up with an item {\"done\": true} having no \"title\" field. Image credit: Figure 6 from the paper.\n\n\nThis blog post will instead teach you how to design CRDTs from the ground up. I’ll present a few simple CRDTs that are obviously correct, plus ways to compose them together into complicated whole-app CRDTs that are still obviously correct. I’ll also present principles of CRDT design to help guide you through the process. To cap it off, we’ll design a CRDT for a collaborative spreadsheet.\nUltimately, I hope that you will gain not just an understanding of some existing CRDT designs, but also the confidence to tweak them and create your own!\nRelated Work\nThe CRDTs I describe are based on Shapiro et al. 2011 unless noted otherwise. However, the way I describe them, and the design principles and composition techniques, are my own way of thinking about CRDT design. It’s inspired by the way Figma and Hex describe their collaboration platforms; they likewise support complex apps by composing simple, easy-to-reason-about pieces. Relative to those platforms, I incorporate more academic CRDT designs, enabling more flexible behavior and server-free operation.\n\nBasic Designs\nI’ll start by going over some basic CRDT designs.\nUnique Set\nOur foundational CRDT is the Unique Set.  It is a set in which each added element is considered unique.\nFormally, the user-facing operations on the set, and their collaborative implementations, are as follows:\n\nadd(x): Adds an element e = (t, x) to the set, where t is a unique new tag, used to ensure that (t, x) is unique. To implement this, the adding user generates t, e.g., as a pair (device id, device-specific counter), then serializes (t, x) and broadcasts it to the other users.  The receivers deserialize (t, x) and add it to their local copy of the set.\ndelete(e): Deletes the element e = (t, x) from the set.  To implement this, the deleting user serializes t and broadcasts it to the other users.  The receivers deserialize t and remove the element with tag t from their local copy, if it has not been deleted already.\n\n\nThe lifecycle of an add or delete operation.\nWhen displaying the set to the user, you ignore the tags and just list out the data values x, keeping in mind that (1) they are not ordered (at least not consistently across different users), and (2) there may be duplicates.\nExample: In a collaborative flash card app, you could represent the deck of cards as a Unique Set, using x to hold the flash card’s value (e.g., its front and back strings). Users can edit the deck by adding a new card or deleting an existing one, and duplicate cards are allowed. \nWhen broadcasting messages, we require that they are delivered reliably and in causal order, but it’s okay if they are arbitarily delayed.  (These rules apply to all CRDTs, not just the Unique Set.) Delivery in causal order means that if a user sends a message \\(m\\) after receiving or sending a message \\(m^\\prime\\), then all users delay receiving \\(m\\) until after receiving \\(m^\\prime\\). This is the strictest ordering we can implement without a central server and without extra round-trips between users, e.g., by using vector clocks.\nMessages that aren’t ordered by the causal order are concurrent, and different users might receive them in different orders. But for CRDT correctness, we must ensure that all users end up in the same state regardless, once they have received the same messages.\nFor the Unique Set, it is obvious that the state of the set, as seen by a specific user, is always the set of elements for which they have received an add message but no delete messages. This holds regardless of the order in which they received concurrent messages. Thus the Unique Set is correct.\n\nNote that delivery in causal order is important—a delete operation only works if it is received after its corresponding add operation.\n\n\nWe now have our first principle of CRDT design:\nPrinciple 1. Use the Unique Set CRDT for operations that “add” or “create” a unique new thing.\nAlthough it is simple, the Unique Set forms the basis for the rest of our CRDTs.\n\nLists\nOur next CRDT is a list CRDT. It represents a list of elements, with insert and delete operations. For example, you can use a list CRDT of characters to store the text in a collaborative text editor, using insert to type a new character and delete for backspace.\nFormally, the operations on a list CRDT are:\n\ninsert(i, x): Inserts a new element with value x at index i, between the existing elements at indices i and i+1. All later elements (index &gt;= i+1) are shifted one to the right.\ndelete(i): Deletes the element at index i. All later elements (index &gt;= i+1) are shifted one to the left.\n\nWe now need to decide on the semantics, i.e., what is the result of various insert and delete operations, possibly concurrent. The fact that insertions are unique suggests using a Unique Set (Principle 1). However, we also have to account for indices and the list order.\nOne approach would use indices directly: when a user calls insert(i, x), they send (i, x) to the other users, who use i to insert x at the appropriate location. The challenge is that your intended insertion index might move around as a result of users’ inserting/deleting in front of i.\n\nAlice typed \" the\" at index 17, but concurrently, Bob typed \" gray\" in front of her. From Bob's perspective, Alice's insert should happen at index 22.\nIt’s possible to work around this by “transforming” i to account for concurrent edits. That idea leads to Operational Transformation (OT), the earliest-invented approach to collaborative text editing, and the one used in Google Docs and most existing apps. Unfortunately, OT algorithms are quite complicated, leading to numerous flawed algorithms. You can reduce complexity by using a central server to manage the document, like Google Docs does, but that precludes decentralized networks, end-to-end encryption, and server-free open-source apps.\n\nList CRDTs use a different perspective from OT.  When you type a character in a text document, you probably don’t think of its position as “index 17” or whatever; instead, its position is at a certain place within the existing text.\n“A certain place within the existing text” is vague, but at a minimum, it should be between the characters left and right of your insertion point (“on” and “ table“ in the example above)  Also, unlike an index, this intuitive position is immutable.\nThis leads to the following implementation. The list’s state is a Unique Set whose values are pairs (p, x), where x is the actual value (e.g., a character), and p is a unique immutable position drawn from some abstract total order. The user-visible state of the list is the list of values x ordered by their positions p. Operations are implemented as:\n\ninsert(i, x): The inserting user looks up the positions pL, pR of the values to the left and right (indices i and i+1), generates a unique new position p such that pL &lt; p &lt; pR, and calls add((p, x)) on the Unique Set.\ndelete(i): The deleting user finds the element e of the Unique Set at index i, then calls delete(e) on the Unique Set.\n\nOf course, we need a way to create the positions p. That’s the hard part—in fact, the hardest part of any CRDT—and I don’t have space to go into it here; you should use an existing algorithm (e.g., RGA) or implementation (e.g., Yjs’s Y.Array).  \nThe important lesson here is that we had to translate indices (the language of normal, non-CRDT lists) into unique immutable positions (what the user intuitively means when they say “insert here”).  That leads to our second principle of CRDT design:\nPrinciple 2. Express operations in terms of user intention—what the operation means to the user, intuitively. This might differ from the closest ordinary data type operation.\nRegisters\nOur last basic CRDT is the register. This is a variable that holds an arbitrary value that can be set and get. If multiple users set the value at the same time, you pick one of them arbitrarily, or perhaps average them together.\nExample uses for registers:\n\nThe font size of a character in a collaborative rich-text editor.\nThe name of a document.\nThe color of a specific pixel in a collaborative whiteboard.\nBasically, anything where you’re fine with users overwriting each others’ concurrent changes and you don’t want to use a more complicated CRDT.\n\nRegisters are very useful and suffice for many tasks (e.g., Figma and Hex use them almost exclusively).\nThe only operation on a register is set(x), which sets the value to x (in the absence of concurrent operations). We can’t perform these operations literally, since if two users receive concurrent set operations in different orders, they’ll end up with different values.\nHowever, we can add the value x to a Unique Set, following Principle 1. The state is now a set of values instead of a single value, but we’ll address that soon. We can also delete old values each time set(x) is called, overwriting them.\nThus the implementation of set(x) becomes:\n\nFor each element e in the Unique Set, call delete(e) on the Unique Set; then call add(x).\n\nThe result is that at any time, the register’s state is the set of all the most recent concurrently-set values.\nLoops of the form “for each element of a collection, do something” are common in programming. We just saw a way to extend them to CRDTs: “for each element of a Unique Set, do some CRDT operation”. I call this a causal for-each operation because it only affects elements that are prior to the for-each operation in the causal order. It’s useful enough that we make it our next principle of CRDT design:\nPrinciple 3a. For operations that do something “for each” element of a collection, one option is to use a causal for-each operation on a Unique Set (or list CRDT).\n(Later we will expand on this with Principle 3b, which also concerns for-each operations.)\nReturning to registers, we still need to handle the fact that our state is a set of values, instead of a specific value.\nOne option is to accept this as the state, and present all conflicting values to the user.  That gives the Multi-Value Register (MVR).\nAnother option is to pick a value arbitrarily but deterministically.  E.g., the Last-Writer Wins (LWW) Register tags each value with the wall-clock time when it is set, then picks the value with the latest timestamp.\n\nIn Pixelpusher, a collaborative pixel art editor, each pixel shows one color by default (LWW Register), but you can click to pop out all conflicting colors (MVR). Image credit: Peter van Hardenberg (original).\nIn general, you can define the value getter to be an arbitrary deterministic function of the set of values.\nExamples:\n\nIf the values are colors, you can average their RGB coordinates.\n\n\n\nIf the values are booleans, you can choose to prefer true values, i.e., the register’s value is true if its set contains any true values. That gives the Enable-Wins Flag.\n\nComposing CRDTs\nWe now have enough basic CRDTs to start making more complicated data structures through composition. I’ll describe three techniques: CRDT objects, CRDT-valued maps, and collections of CRDTs.\nCRDT Objects\nThe simplest composition technique is to use multiple CRDTs side-by-side. By making them instance fields in a class, you obtain a CRDT Object, which is itself a CRDT (trivially correct). The power of CRDT objects comes from using standard OOP techniques, e.g., implementation hiding.\nExamples:\n\nIn a collaborative flash card app, to make individual cards editable, you could represent each card as a CRDT object with two text CRDT (list CRDT of characters) instance fields, one for the front and one for the back.\nYou can represent the position and size of an image in a collaborative slide editor by using separate registers for the left, top, width, and height. \n\n\nTo implement a CRDT object, each time an instance field requests to broadcast a message, the CRDT object broadcasts that message tagged with the field’s name. Receivers then deliver the message to their own instance field with the same name. \nCRDT-Valued Map\nA CRDT-valued map is like a CRDT object but with potentially infinite instance fields, one for each allowed map key. Every key/value pair is implicitly always present in the map, but values are only explicitly constructed in memory as needed, using a predefined factory method (like Apache Commons’ LazyMap).\nExamples:\n\nConsider a shared notes app in which users can archive notes, then restore them later. To indicate which notes are normal (not archived), we want to store them in a set. A Unique Set won’t work, since the same note can be added (restored) multiple times. Instead, you can use a CRDT-valued map whose keys are the documents and whose values are enable-wins flags; the value of the flag for key doc indicates whether doc is in the set. This gives the Add-Wins Set.\nQuill lets you easily display and edit rich text in a browser app. In a Quill document, each character has an attributes map, which contains arbitrary key-value pairs describing formatting (e.g., \"bold\": true). You can model this using a CRDT-valued map with arbitrary keys and LWW register values; the value of the register for key attr indicates the current value for attr.\n\nA CRDT-valued map is implemented like a CRDT object: each message broadcast by a value CRDT is tagged with its serialized key. Internally, the map stores only the explicitly-constructed key-value pairs; each value is constructed using the factory method the first time it is accessed by the local user or receives a message. However, this is not visible externally—from the outside, the other values still appear present, just in their initial states. (If you want an explicit set of “present” keys, you can track them using an Add-Wins Set.)\n\nCRDT-valued maps are based on the Riak map.\n\n\nCollections of CRDTs\nOur above definition of a Unique Set implicitly assumed that the data values x were immutable and serializable (capable of being sent over the network). However, we can also make a Unique Set of CRDTs, whose values are dynamically-created CRDTs.\nTo add a new value CRDT, a user sends a unique new tag and any arguments needed to construct the value. Each recipient passes those arguments to a predefined factory method, then stores the returned CRDT in their copy of the set. When a value CRDT is deleted, it is forgotten and can no longer be used.\nNote that unlike in a CRDT-valued map, values are explicitly created (with dynamic constructor arguments) and deleted—the set effectively provides collaborative new and free operations.\nWe can likewise make a list of CRDTs.\nExamples:\n\nIn a shared folder containing multiple collaborative documents, you can define your document CRDT, then use a Unique Set of document CRDTs to model the whole folder. (You can also use a CRDT-valued map from names to documents, but then documents can’t be renamed, and documents “created” concurrently with the same name will end up merged.)\n\n\n\nContinuing the Quill rich-text example from the previous section, you can model a rich-text document as a list of “rich character CRDTs”, where each “rich character CRDT” consists of an immutable (non-CRDT) character plus the attributes map CRDT. This is sufficient to build a simple Google Docs-style app with CRDTs (source).\n\nUsing Composition\nYou can use the above composition techniques and basic CRDTs to design CRDTs for many collaborative apps. Choosing the exact structure, and how operations and user-visible state map onto that structure, is the main challenge.\nA good starting point is to design an ordinary (non-CRDT) data model, using ordinary objects, collections, etc., then convert it to a CRDT version. So variables become registers, sets become Unique Sets or Add-Wins Sets, etc. You can then tweak the design as needed to accommodate extra operations or fix weird concurrent behaviors.\nTo accommodate as many operations as possible while preserving user intention, I recommend:\nPrinciple 4. Independent operations (in the user’s mind) should act on independent state.\nExamples:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can represent the position and size of an image in a collaborative slide editor by using separate registers for the left, top, width, and height. If you wanted, you could instead use a single register whose value is a tuple (left, top, width, height), but this would violate Principle 4. Indeed, then if one user moved the image while another resized it, one of their changes would overwrite the other, instead of both moving and resizing. \nAgain in a collaborative slide editor, you might initially model the slide list as a list of slide CRDTs. However, this provides no way for users to move slides around in the list, e.g., swap the order of two slides. You could implement a move operation using cut-and-paste, but then slide edits concurrent to a move will be lost, even though they are intuitively independent operations.\nFollowing Principle 4, you should instead implement move operations by modifying some state independent of the slide itself. You can do this by replacing the list of slides with a Unique Set of objects { slide, positionReg }, where positionReg is an LWW register indicating the position. To move a slide, you create a unique new position like in a list CRDT, then set the value of positionReg equal to that position. This construction gives the list-with-move CRDT.\n\nNew: Concurrent+Causal For-Each Operations\nThere’s one more trick I want to show you. Sometimes, when performing a for-each operation on a Unique Set or list CRDT (Principle 3a), you don’t just want to affect existing (causally prior) elements. You also want to affect elements that are added/inserted concurrently.\nFor example:\n\nIn a rich text editor, if one user bolds a range of text, while concurrently, another user types in the middle of the range, the latter text should also be bolded.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the first user’s intended operation is “for each character in the range including ones inserted concurrently, bold it”.\nIn a collaborative recipe editor, if one user clicks a “double the recipe” button, while concurrently, another user edits an amount, then their edit should also be doubled. Otherwise, the recipe will be out of proportion, and the meal will be ruined!\n\nI call such an operation a concurrent+causal for-each operation. To accomodate the above examples, I propose the following addendum to Principle 3a:\nPrinciple 3b. For operations that do something “for each” element of a collection, another option is to use a concurrent+causal for-each operation on a Unique Set (or list CRDT).\nTo implement this, the initiating user first does a causal for-each operation. They then send a message describing how to perform the operation on concurrently added elements. The receivers apply the operation to any concurrently added elements they’ve received already (and haven’t yet deleted), then store the message in a log. Later, each time they receive a new element, they check if it’s concurrent to the stored message; if so, they apply the operation.\n\nConcurrent+causal for-each operations are novel as far as I’m aware. They are based on a paper I, Heather Miller, and Christopher Meiklejohn wrote last year, about a composition technique we call the semidirect product, which can implement them (albeit in a confusing way). \n\n\n\nCase Study: A Collaborative Spreadsheet\nNow let’s get practical: we’re going to design a CRDT for a collaborative spreadsheet editor (think Google Sheets).\nAs practice, try sketching a design yourself before reading any further. The rest of this section describes how I would do it, but don’t worry if you come up with something different—there’s no one right answer! The point of this blog post is to give you the confidence to design and tweak CRDTs like this yourself, not to dictate “the one true spreadsheet CRDT™”.\nDesign Walkthrough\nTo start off, consider an individual cell. Fundamentally, it consists of a text string. We could make this a text (list) CRDT, but usually, you don’t edit individual cells collaboratively; instead, you type the new value of the cell, hit enter, and then its value shows up for everyone else. This suggests instead using a register, e.g., an LWW register.\nBesides the text content, a cell can have properties like its font size, whether word wrap is enabled, etc. Since changing these properties are all independent operations, following Principle 4, they should have independent state. This suggests using a CRDT object to represent the cell, with a different CRDT instance field for each property. In pseudocode (classes are implicitly CRDT objects):\n\nThe spreadsheet itself is a grid of cells. Each cell is indexed by its location (row, column), suggesting a map from locations to cells. (A 2D list could work too, but then we’d have to put rows and columns on an unequal footing, which might cause trouble later.) Thus let’s use a Cell-CRDT-valued map.\nWhat about the map keys? It’s tempting to use conventional row-column indicators like “A1”, “B3”, etc. However, then we can’t easily insert or delete rows/columns, since doing so renames other cells’ indicators. (We could try making a “rename” operation, but that violates Principle 2, since it does not match the user’s original intention: inserting/deleting a different row/column.)\nInstead, let’s identify cell locations using pairs (row, column), where “row” means “the line of cells horizontally adjacent to this cell”, independent of that row’s literal location (1, 2, etc.), and likewise for “column”. That is, we create an opaque Row object to represent each row, and likewise for columns, then use pairs (Row, Column) for our map keys.\nThe word “create” suggests using Unique Sets (Principle 1), although since the rows and columns are ordered, we actually want list CRDTs. Hence our app state looks like:\n\nNow you can insert or delete rows and columns by calling the appropriate operations on columns and rows, without affecting the cells map at all. (Due to the lazy nature of the map, we don’t have to explicitly create cells to fill a new row or column; they implicitly already exist.)\nSpeaking of rows and columns, there’s more we can do here. For example, rows have editable properties like their height, whether they are visible, etc. These properties are independent, so they should have independent states (Principle 4). This suggests making Row into a CRDT object:\n\nAlso, we want to be able to move rows and columns around. We already described how to do this using a list-with-move:\n\nNext, we can also perform operations on every cell in a row, like changing the font size of every cell. For each such operation, we have three options:\n\nUse a causal for-each operation (Principle 3a). This will affect all current cells in the row, but not any cells that are created concurrently (when a new column is inserted). E.g., a “clear” operation that sets every cell’s value to \"\".\nUse a concurrent+causal for-each operation (Principle 3b). This will affect all current cells in the row and any created concurrently. E.g., changing the font size of a whole row.\nUse an independent state that affects the row itself, not the cells (Principle 4). E.g., our usage of Row.height for the height of a row.\n\n\n\nFinished Design\nIn summary, the state of our spreadsheet is as follows.\n\nNote that I never explicitly mentioned CRDT correctness—the claim that all users see the same document state after receiving the same messages. Because we assembled the design from existing CRDTs using composition techniques that preserve CRDT correctness, it is trivially correct. Plus, it should be straightforward to reason out what would happen in various concurrency scenarios.\nAs exercises, here are some further tweaks you can make to this design, phrased as user requests:\n\n“I’d like to have multiple sheets in the same document, accessible by tabs at the bottom of the screen, like in Excel.” Hint (highlight to reveal): Use a list of CRDTs.\n“I’ve noticed that if I change the font size of a cell, while at the same time someone else changes the font size for the whole row, sometimes their change overwrites mine. I’d rather keep my change, since it’s more specific.” Hint: Use a register with a custom getter.\n“I want to reference other cells in formulas, e.g., = A2 + B3. Later, if B3 moves to C3, its references should update too.” Hint: Store the reference as something immutable.\n\nConclusion\nI hope you’ve gained an understanding of how CRDTs work, plus perhaps a desire to apply them in your own apps. We covered a lot:\n\nTraditional CRDTs: Unique Set, List/Text, LWW Register, Enable-Wins Flag, Add-Wins Set, CRDT-Valued Map, and List-with-Move.\nNovel Operations: Concurrent+causal for-each operations on a Unique Set or list.\nWhole Apps: Spreadsheet, rich text, and pieces of various other apps.\n\nFor more info, crdt.tech collects most CRDT resources in one place.\nI’ve also started putting these ideas into practice in a library, Collabs. You can learn more about Collabs, and see how open-source collaborative apps might work in practice, in my Strange Loop talk.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Justine Sherry, Jonathan Aldrich, and Pratik Fegade for reviewing this post and giving helpful feedback.

X-axis represents calendar date, left Y-axis represents the total fraction of the IO used by conversion, right Y-axis shows the size of the cluster in terms of the number of disks.\nObserve that the total IO used by code conversion can use up to 100% of the cluster IO during significant periods of time.\nTherefore, the default approach to code conversion can easily overwhelm a storage system, interfering with other important (foreground) tasks such as serving user requests.\nIn this post, we summarize our work on convertible codes, which are erasure codes that can be converted more efficiently than the default approach.\nSo far the information theory community has extensively studied various aspects of storage codes such as rate, update cost, repair bandwidth, and repair locality.\nThe conversion problem opens up a new dimension to optimize for when designing storage codes.\nThere are several open problems in this new design space, with a high potential for real-world impact.\nWe start by providing some background about storage systems, erasure codes, and the way erasure codes are used in storage systems.\nThen, we introduce and formally define code conversion and convertible codes.\nAfterwards, we provide a summary of our results and showcase some examples that show how convertible codes can reduce conversion cost.\nFinally, we conclude with some open problems.\nBackground on storage systems\nMany modern applications require storing large amounts of data; amounts which far exceed the capacity of a single disk drive.\nIn such cases, data needs to be distributed across many disks, attached to many different machines.\nOne immediate problem that emerges in this scenario is that, as the number of components in the system increases, the probability that at least one component fails becomes very high.\nBecause distributed systems need to keep running despite of these failures, reliability is an essential part of their design.\nThe simplest way of adding reliability to a distributed storage system is to use replication: each piece of data has multiple copies each stored in a different disk, so that if any disk fails, no data is permanently lost.\nHowever, replication significantly increases the total amount of space used by the system, which makes it very expensive to use in large-scale systems.\nFor example, three-replication (which tolerates up to two failures) is used in some systems, and it uses 200% additional storage.\nStorage cost is normally measured as the ratio of the total space used to the size of the original data, and is called storage overhead.\nSo three-replication incurs a storage overhead of 3.\nGiven the high cost of replication, nowadays most storage systems use erasure coding instead, which can offer the same (or even higher) reliability guarantees while using much less storage space.\nFor example, an \\([5, 3]\\) MDS code (explained in detail in Background on erasure codes) can tolerate up to two failures (same as three-replication) and has a storage overhead of \\(\\frac{5}{3} = 1.66\\), i.e., only 66.6% extra storage.\nStorage overhead is one of the main cost metrics for distributed storage systems.\nThis is because the top costs of running a system come from the cost of buying all the necessary hardware, and operating it: i.e. providing infrastructure, power, cooling, networking, etc.\nSuch is the scale of these systems, that even a single-digit percentage reduction in storage overhead is significant.\nThere are many other costs and metrics apart from storage overhead.\nAmong them, disk I/O resources come first, because it is important for the performance of the system.\nHDDs offer relatively low I/O bandwidth compared to the total amount of storage space, so this is often the bottleneck of the system’s throughput.\nDue to the mechanical overheads involved in moving the read head to the right place within a disk, the number of I/O operations (called accesses) is also an important metric.\nSimilarly, the amount of network I/O operations, CPU, and memory usage are also important.\nDistributed storage system design\nOne of the most well-known types of distributed storage systems is RAID.\nA RAID system typically consists of an array of \\(n\\) disks with same capacity attached to a single machine.\nData is encoded with an \\([n, k]\\) MDS (maximum distance separable) code and for each codeword, each of the \\(n\\) codeword symbols is placed on a different disk.\nModern distributed storage systems require to scale past a single machine, and thus have a different design from RAID.\nAn example of such a system is HDFS, which also supports erasure coding.\nThese systems manage a large number of nodes and disks: sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of them.\nAs in RAID, data is encoded with an \\([n, k]\\) MDS code, and each codeword symbol is placed on a different disk, but \\(n\\) is much smaller than the number of disks (typically \\(n \\leq 50\\)).\nThe disks where a codeword is placed are chosen by a semi-random placement algorithm, which tries to avoid choosing disks that might fail at the same time (e.g., by choosing disks in different racks).\nBackground on erasure codes\nWhile many types of erasure codes exists, in this post we will focus specifically on linear erasure codes with the MDS property, which we explain in the following.\nAn \\([n, k]\\) MDS (maximum-distance separable) erasure code takes \\(k\\) symbols of data, and encodes them into \\(n\\) code symbols with the property that any \\(k\\) out of the \\(n\\) code symbols can recover the original \\(k\\) data symbols.\nSymbols are elements from a specific finite field (denoted \\(\\mathbb{F}\\)).\nMany practical applications use the finite field \\(\\mathrm{GF}(2^8)\\), where each symbol is represented as a single byte.\nLet \\(r \\coloneqq n - k\\), and let \\([i] = \\{1,2,\\ldots,i\\}\\).\nMathematically, an \\([n, k]\\) erasure code over \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) is a function \\(\\mathcal{C}: \\mathbb{F}^{k} \\to \\mathbb{F}^{n}\\).\nElements in the image of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) are called codewords.\nA linear code can be described by the mapping \\(\\mathbf{m} \\to \\mathbf{m} \\mathbf{G}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is the \\(k \\times n\\) generator matrix.\nA code is MDS iff for any codeword it is possible to recover the original data after erasing any \\(r\\) arbitrary symbols.\nFor linear codes, this is equivalent to the property that the \\(k \\times k\\) matrix formed by the columns corresponding to any \\(k\\) code symbols is invertible.\nIn practice, systematic codes are often used, which permit reading data without decoding.\nA linear code is said to be systematic if its generator matrix contains a \\(k \\times k\\) identity matrix as a submatrix; for such codes, we refer to the \\(k \\times r\\) submatrix defined by the remaining columns as the parity matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\).\nThe code conversion problem\nThe problem of changing data encoded under an initial code \\(\\mathcal{C}^I\\) to its corresponding encoding under a final code \\(\\mathcal{C}^F\\) is called code conversion.\nIn this section, we describe convertible codes, which are capable of efficiently changing the erasure code parameters from \\([n^I, k^I]\\) to \\([n^F, k^F]\\).\nLet us start by showing an example of convertible codes in action.\n\nFigure 2: Example of code conversion from a \\([7,4]\\) MDS code to a \\([11,8]\\) MDS code.\n\n\nExample 1. Consider conversion from \\([n^I = 7, k^I = 4]\\) to \\([n^F = 11, k^F = 8]\\).\nIn this example, both codes are systematic (i.e. the data symbols are contained in the codewords), and each box represents a symbol.\nTwo codewords from the \\([7,4]\\) code are combined to obtain a single codeword from the \\([11,8]\\) code.\nThe first observation we make is that since both codes are systematic, we can simply keep the data symbols where they are (i.e., unchanged) through the conversion (dashed arrows).\nThus, in this case, we only need to define how the new parities are computed.\nThe default approach to conversion would be to read all of the data symbols \\((a_1,\\ldots,a_8)\\), and use those to compute the new parities \\(q_1, q_2\\).\nHowever, it is possible to reduce that cost.\nLet the field \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) be the integers modulo 17.\nWhen we define the code, we want to ensure two properties: (1) the initial and final codes are MDS, and (2) the new parities can be computed efficiently.\nTo ensure this, we build the code from a Vandermonde matrix.\nIn a Vandermonde matrix, each column is determined by an evaluation point (an element from the field), and row \\(i\\) corresponds to the evaluation point raised to the power of \\(i - 1\\).\nWe can carefully choose the evaluation points to ensure the MDS property holds (it does not suffice to just choose distinct point).\nChoosing evaluation points \\((\\theta_1 = 1, \\theta_2 = 2, \\theta_3 = 6)\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}^F =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\\n\\theta_1 &amp; \\theta_2 &amp; \\theta_3 \\\\\n\\theta_1^2 &amp; \\theta_2^2 &amp; \\theta_3^2 \\\\\n\\theta_1^3 &amp; \\theta_2^3 &amp; \\theta_3^3 \\\\\n\\theta_1^4 &amp; \\theta_2^4 &amp;

and\na conversion procedure that on input \\({\\mathcal{C}^I(\\mathbf{m}_P) \\mid P \\in \\mathcal{P}^I}\\) outputs \\({\\mathcal{C}^F(\\mathbf{m}_P) \\mid P \\in \\mathcal{P}^F}\\), for any \\(\\mathbf{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{\\mathrm{lcm}(k^I,k^F)}\\).\n\n\nConversion procedure\nThe objective of the conversion procedure is to convert the initial codewords into the final codewords efficiently.\nThis is modeled with a converter which reads data from some symbols in the initial codewords, and computes new symbols in the final codewords.\nAs seen in the figure above, not all symbols in the final codewords need to be new; some symbols can be kept unchanged from the initial codewords, which incurs no cost.\nSince our objective is to minimize cost, we will focus only on the so-called stable convertible codes, which have \\(k^F\\) unchanged symbols in each final codeword (which was proven in Maturana &amp; Rashmi, 2022a to be the maximum possible).\nTo decide whether a conversion procedure is efficient, we need to measure its cost.\nSince each final codeword has exactly \\(r^F\\) new symbols, the cost of writing the new symbols is fixed, regardless of the conversion procedure.\nTherefore, we will focus only the read costs of conversion.\nTwo types of cost have been considered in the literature.\n\nDefinition (Access cost).\nThe total number of symbols read by the converter.\n\n\n\nDefinition (Conversion bandwidth).\nThe total size of the data read by the converter (note that the converter may read only part of a symbol).\n\n\nIn this post, we will focus only on access cost.\nConversion regimes\nTo facilitate the study of convertible codes, two special subcases have been identified in the literature.\n\nDefinition (Merge regime).\nCode conversions which merge multiple codewords into a single one, i.e., \\(\\lambda^I \\geq 2\\), \\(\\lambda^F = 1\\), and \\(k^F = \\lambda^I k^F\\), with arbitrary \\(n^I\\) and \\(n^F\\).\n\n\n\nDefinition (Split regime).\nCode conversions which split a single codeword into a multiple one, i.e., \\(\\lambda^I = 1\\), \\(\\lambda^F \\geq 2\\), and \\(k^I = \\lambda^F k^F\\), with arbitrary \\(n^I\\) and \\(n^F\\).\n\n\nThe case where all parameters \\((n^I,k^I,n^F,k^F)\\) are arbitrary is referred to as the general regime.\nThe benefit of studying the merge regime and the split regime separately, is that in these two subcases one need not worry about defining the partitions \\(\\mathcal{P}^I\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}^F\\), which simplifies the analysis.\nThis is because in these two subcases all data gets mapped to the same codeword (either in the initial or final configuration).\nThus, all partitions are equivalent by just relabeling the symbols.\nMinimizing the access cost of conversion\nThe following table shows the known lower bounds for the access cost of conversion.\nIn this section, we will describe the constructions that achieve each of the non-trivial bounds.\n\nTable.

We will show that\n\nConventional-wisdom-suggested “weak LRUs”, e.g., FIFO-Reinsertion, is actually more efficient (having lower miss ratios) than LRU;\nSimply evicting most new objects quickly can improve the state-of-the-art algorithm’s efficiency.\nEviction algorithms can be designed like building with LEGOs by adding lazy promotion and quick demotion on top of FIFO.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCaching is a well-known and widely deployed technique to speed up data access, reduce repeated computation and data transfer.\nA core component of a cache is the eviction algorithm, which chooses the objects stored in the limited cache space.\nTwo metrics describe the performance of an eviction algorithm: efficiency measured by the miss ratio and throughput measured by the number of requests served that can be served per second.\nThe study of cache eviction algorithms has a long history, with a majority of the work centered around LRU (that is, to evict the least-recently-used object).\nGenerally, LRU maintains a doubly-linked list, promoting objects to the head of the list upon cache hits and evicting the object at the tail of the list when needed.\nBelady and others found that memory access patterns often exhibit temporal locality — “the most recently used pages were most likely to be reused in the immediate future”. Thus, LRU using recency to promote objects was found to be better than FIFO.\nMost eviction algorithms designed to achieve high efficiency start from LRU.\nFor example, many algorithms, such as ARC, SLRU, 2Q, MQ, and multi-generational LRU, use multiple LRU queues to separate hot and cold objects. Some algorithms, e.g., LIRS, maintain an LRU queue but use different metrics to promote objects. While other algorithms, e.g., LRFU, EE-LRU, LeCaR, and CACHEUS, augment LRU’s recency with different metrics. In addition, many recent works, e.g., Talus, improve LRU’s ability to handle scan and loop requests.\nBesides efficiency (miss ratio), there have been fruitful studies on enhancing the cache’s execution performance and thread scalability. Each cache hit in LRU promotes an object to the head of the queue, which requires updating at least six pointers guarded by locks.\nThese overheads are not acceptable in many deployments that need high performance.\nThus, performance-centric systems often use FIFO-based algorithms to avoid LRU’s overheads.\nFor example, FIFO-Reinsertion and variants of CLOCK have been developed, which serve as LRU approximations.\nIt is often perceived that these algorithms trade miss ratio for better throughput and scalability.\nIn this blog, I am going to show that FIFO is in-fact better than LRU not only because of higher throughput, better scalability, but also because of improved effectiveness (having lower miss ratios).\nWhy FIFO and What it needs\nFIFO has many benefits over LRU.\nFor example, FIFO has less metadata and requires no metadata update on each cache hit, and thus is faster and more scalable than LRU. In contrast, LRU requires updating six pointers on each cache hit, which is not friendly for modern computer architecture due to random memory accesses. Moreover, FIFO is always the first choice when implementing a flash cache because it does not incur write amplification. Although FIFO has throughput and scalability benefits, it is conventional wisdom that FIFO is less effective (having higher miss ratio) than LRU.\n\n\nA cache can be viewed as a logically ordered queue with four operations: insertion, removal, promotion and demotion. Most eviction algorithms can be viewed as promotion algorithms because they focus on how to promote objects. \n\n\nTo understand the various factors that affect the miss ratio, we introduce a cache abstraction.\nA cache can be viewed as a logically total-ordered queue with four operations: insertion, removal, promotion, and demotion.\nObjects in the cache can be compared and ordered based on some metric (e.g., time since the last request), and the eviction algorithm evicts the least valuable object based on the metric.\nInsertion and removal are user-controlled operations, where removal can either be directly invoked by the user or indirectly via the use of time-to-live (TTL).\nPromotion and demotion are internal operations of the cache used to maintain the logical ordering between objects.\nWe observe that most eviction algorithms use promotion to update the ordering between objects.\nFor example, LRU-based algorithms promote objects to the head of the queue on cache hits, which we call eager promotion.\nMeanwhile, demotion is performed implicitly: when an object is promoted, other objects are passively demoted.\nWe call this process passive demotion, a slow process as objects need to traverse through the cache queue before being evicted.\nHowever, we will show that instead of eager promotion and passive demotion, eviction algorithms should use lazy promotion and quick demotion.\nLazy Promotion\nTo avoid popular objects from being evicted while not incurring much performance overhead, we propose adding lazy promotion on top of FIFO (called  LP-FIFO), which promotes objects only when they are about to be evicted.\nlazy promotion aims to retain popular objects with minimal effort.\nAn example is FIFO-Reinsertion (note that FIFO-Reinsertion, 1-bit CLOCK, and Second Chance are different implementations of the same eviction algorithm): an object is reinserted at eviction time if it has been requested while in the cache.\nLP-FIFO has several benefits over eager promotion (promoting on every access) used in LRU-based algorithms.\nFirst, LP-FIFO inherits FIFO’s throughput and scalability benefits because few metadata operations are needed when an object is requested. For example, FIFO-Reinsertion only needs to update a Boolean field upon the first request to a cached object without locking.\nSecond, performing promotion at eviction time allows the cache to make better decisions by accumulating more information about the objects, e.g., how many times an object has been requested.\n\nTraceapprox time#tracecache type#req (millions)#obj (millions)\nMSR200713block41074\nFIU20089block51420\nCloudphysics2015106block2,114492\nMajor CDN2018219object3,728298\nTencent Photo20182object5,6501,038\nWiki CDN20193object2,86356\nTencent CBS20204030block33,690551\nAlibaba2020652block19,6761702\nTwitter202054KV195,44110,650\nSocial Network2020219KV549,78442,898\n\nTo understand LP-FIFO’s efficiency,\nwe performed a large-scale simulation study on 5307 production traces from 10 data sources, which include open-source and proprietary datasets collected between 2007 and 2020.\nThe 10 datasets contain 814 billion (6,386 TB) requests and 55.2 billion (533 TB) objects, and cover different types of caches, including block, key-value (KV), and object caches.\nWe further divide the traces into block and web (including Memcached and CDN).\nWe choose small/large cache size as 0.1%/10% of the number of unique objects in the trace.\nWe compare the miss ratios of LRU with two LP-FIFO algorithms:\nFIFO-Reinsertion and 2-bit CLOCK.\n2-bit CLOCK tracks object frequency up to three, and an object’s frequency decreases by one each time the CLOCK hand scans through it. Objects with frequency zero are evicted.\nCommon wisdom suggests that these two LP-FIFO examples are LRU approximations and will exhibit higher miss ratios than LRU.\nHowever, we found that LP-FIFO often exhibits miss ratios lower than LRU.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of FIFO-Reinsertion and LRU on 10 datasets with 5307 traces. Left: small cache, right: large cache. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of 2-bit CLOCK and LRU on 10 datasets with 5307 traces. Left: small cache, right: large cache. A longer bar means the algorithm is more efficient (having lower miss ratios on more traces). Note that we do not consider the overhead of LRU metadata in these evaluations. \n\nThe figure above shows that FIFO-Reinsertion and 2-bit CLOCK are better than LRU on most traces.\nSpecifically, FIFO-Reinsertion is better than LRU on 9 and 7 of the 10 datasets using a small and large cache size, respectively.\nMoreover, on half of the datasets, more than 80% of the traces in each dataset favor FIFO-Reinsertion over LRU at both sizes.\nOn the two social network datasets, LRU is better than FIFO-Reinsertion (especially at the large cache size). This is because most objects in these two datasets are accessed more than once, and using one bit to track object access is insufficient. Therefore, when increasing the one bit in FIFO-Reinsertion (CLOCK) to two bits (2-bit CLOCK), we observe that the number of traces favoring LP-FIFO increases to around 70%.\nAcross all datasets, 2-bit CLOCK is better than FIFO on all datasets at the small cache size and 9 of the 10 datasets at the large cache size.\n\n\nFIFO-Reinsertion demotes new objects faster than LRU because objects requested before the new object also pushes it down the queue.\n\nTwo reasons contribute to LP-FIFO’s high effectiveness.\nFirst, lazy promotion often leads to quick demotion. For example, under LRU, a newly-inserted object G is pushed down the queue only by (1) new objects and (2) cached objects that are requested after G. However, besides the objects requested after G, the objects requested before G (but have not been promoted, e.g., B, D) also push G down the queue when using FIFO-Reinsertion.\nSecond, compared to promotion at each request, object ordering in LP-FIFO is closer to the insertion order, which we conjecture is better suited for many workloads that exhibit popularity decay — old objects have a lower probability of getting a request.\nWhile LP-FIFO surprisingly wins over LRU in miss ratio, it does not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. We next discuss another building block that bridges this gap.\nQuick Demotion\nEfficient eviction algorithms not only need to keep popular objects in the cache but also need to evict unpopular objects fast. In this section, we show that quick demotion (QD) is critical for an efficient eviction algorithm, and it enables FIFO-based algorithms to achieve state-of-the-art efficiency.\nBecause demotion happens passively in most eviction algorithms, an object typically traverses through the cache before being evicted. Such traversal gives each object a good chance to prove its value to be kept in the cache.\nHowever, cache workloads often follow Zipf popularity distribution, with most objects being unpopular.\nThis is further exacerbated by (1) the scan and loop access patterns in the block cache workloads, and (2) the vast existence of dynamic and short-lived data, the use of versioning in object names, and the use of short TTLs in the web cache workloads.\nWe believe the opportunity cost of new objects demonstrating their values is often too high: the object being evicted at the tail of the queue may be more valuable than the objects recently inserted.\n\n\nAn example of quick demotion: adding a small FIFO to filter most new objects that do not have a request soon after insertion.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of quick demotion, we add a simple QD technique on top of state-of-the-art eviction algorithms.\nThe QD technique consists of a small probationary FIFO queue storing cached data and a ghost FIFO queue storing metadata of objects evicted from the probationary FIFO queue.\nThe probationary FIFO queue uses 10% of the cache space and acts as a filter for unpopular objects: objects not requested after insertion are evicted early from the FIFO queue. The main cache runs a state-of-the-art algorithm and uses 90% of the space.\nAnd the ghost FIFO stores as many entries as the main cache.\nUpon a cache miss, the object is written into the probationary FIFO queue unless it is in the ghost FIFO queue, in which case, it is written into the main cache.\nWhen the probationary FIFO queue is full, if the object to evict has been accessed since insertion, it is inserted into the main cache. Otherwise, it is evicted and recorded in the ghost FIFO queue.\nWe add this FIFO-based QD technique to five state-of-the-art eviction algorithms, ARC, LIRS, CACHEUS, LeCaR, and LHD.\nWe used the open-source LHD implementation from the authors, implemented the others following the corresponding papers, and cross-checked with open-source implementations.\nWe evaluated the QD-enhanced and original algorithms on the 5307 traces.\nBecause the traces have a wide range of miss ratios, we choose to present each algorithm’s miss ratio reduction from FIFO calculated as (mrFIFO - mralgo) / mrFIFO. Therefore, higher values are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the block (first row) and web traces (second row), quick demotion can improve most state-of-the-art algorithm's efficiency. Left: small cache, right: large cache.\n\nThe figures above show that the QD-enhanced algorithms further reduce the miss ratio of each state-of-the-art algorithm on almost all percentiles. For example, QD-ARC (QD-enhanced ARC) reduces ARC’s miss ratio by up to 59.8% with a mean reduction of 1.5% across all workloads on the two cache sizes, QD-LIRS reduces LIRS’s miss ratio by up to 49.6% with a mean of 2.2%, and QD-LeCaR reduces LeCaR’s miss ratio by up to 58.8% with a mean of 4.5%.\nNote that achieving a large miss ratio reduction on a large number of diverse traces is non-trivial. For example, the best state-of-the-art algorithm, ARC, can only reduce the miss ratio of LRU by 6.2% on average.\nThe gap between the QD-enhanced algorithm and an original algorithm is wider (1) when the state-of-the-art is relatively weak, (2) when the cache size is large, and (3) on the web workloads.\nFirst, With a weaker state-of-the-art, the opportunity for improvement is larger, allowing QD to provide more prominent benefits. For example, QD-LeCaR reduces LeCaR’s miss ratios by 4.5% on average, larger than the reductions on other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nSecond, when the cache size is large, unpopular objects spend more time in the cache, and quick demotion becomes more valuable.\nFor example, QD-ARC and ARC have similar miss ratios on the block workloads at the small cache size. But QD-ARC reduces ARC’s miss ratio by 2.3% on average at the large cache size.\nHowever, when the cache size is too large, e.g., 80% of the number of objects in the trace,\nadding QD may increase the miss ratio (not shown).\nThird, QD provides more benefits on the web workloads than the block workloads, especially when the cache size is small. We conjecture that web workloads have more short-lived data and exhibit stronger popularity decay, which leads to a more urgent need for quick demotion.\nWhile quick demotion improves the efficiency of most state-of-the-art algorithms, for a small subset of traces, QD may increase the miss ratio when the cache size is small because the probationary FIFO is too small to capture some potentially popular objects.\nAlthough adding the probationary FIFO improves efficiency, it further increases the complexity of the already complicated state-of-the-art algorithms.\nTo reduce complexity, we add the same QD technique on top of 2-bit CLOCK and call it QD-LP-FIFO.\nQD-LP-FIFO uses two FIFO queues to cache data and a ghost FIFO queue to track evicted objects.\nIt is not hard to see QD-LP-FIFO is simpler than all state-of-the-art algorithms — it requires at most one metadata update on a cache hit and no locking for any cache operation. Therefore, we believe it will be faster and more scalable than all state-of-the-art algorithms.\nBesides enjoying all the benefits of simplicity, QD-LP-FIFO also achieves lower miss ratios than state-of-the-art algorithms.\nFor example, compared to LIRS and LeCaR, QD-LP-FIFO reduces miss ratio by 1.6% and 4.3% on average, respectively, across the 5307 traces.\nWhile the goal of this work is not to propose a new eviction algorithm, QD-LP-FIFO illustrates how we can build simple yet efficient eviction algorithms by adding quick demotion and lazy promotion techniques to a simple base eviction algorithm such as FIFO.\nDiscussion\nWe have demonstrated reinsertion as an example of LP and the use of a small probationary FIFO queue as an example of QD. However, these are not the only techniques.\nFor example, reinsertion can leverage different metrics to decide whether the object should be reinserted. Besides reinsertion, several other techniques are often used to reduce promotion and improve scalability, e.g., periodic promotion, batched promotion, promoting old objects only, and promoting with try-lock.\nAlthough these techniques do not fall into our strict definition of lazy promotion (promotion on eviction), many of them effectively retain popular objects from being evicted.\nOn the quick demotion side, besides the small probationary FIFO queue, one can leverage other techniques to define and discover unpopular objects such as Hyperbolic and LHD.\nMoreover, admission algorithms, e.g., TinyLFU, Bloom Filter, probabilistic, and ML-based admission algorithms, can be viewed as a form of QD — though some of them are too aggressive at demotion (rejecting objects from entering the cache).\nNote that QD bears similarity with some generational garbage collection algorithms, which separately store short-lived and long-lived data in young-gen and old-gen heaps.\nTherefore, ideas from garbage collection may be borrowed to strengthen cache eviction algorithms.\nThe design of QD-LP-FIFO opens the door to designing simple yet efficient cache eviction algorithms by innovating on LP and QD techniques. And we envision future eviction algorithms can be designed like building LEGO — adding lazy promotion and quick demotion on top of a base eviction algorithm.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/fifo-lru/","title":"FIFO is Better than LRU: the Power of Lazy Promotion and Quick Demotion"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/intermediate-robustness/":{"body":"As machine learning systems become increasingly implemented in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and healthcare, we need to ensure these systems are reliable and trustworthy. For example, we might wish to determine whether a car’s camera-based autopilot system can correctly classify the color of the light even in the presence of severe weather conditions, such as snow. Consider that the average snowy day looks something like the following:\n\nOverall, the visibility is not too bad, and we can guess that these weather conditions do not present too much of an issue for the car’s autopilot system. However, every once in a while, we might get a snowy day that looks more like this:\n\nThe visibility is much worse in this scenario, and these conditions might be more difficult for the car’s autopilot system to safely navigate. However, the traffic light color, as well as most of the objects on the road, can still be identified, and we would hope that the autopilot would be able to operate correctly in these conditions. Finally, very rarely, we might have a snow squall like the following:\n\nThese conditions are so extreme that a human driver would probably need to pull over to the side of the road rather than attempt to drive in with such little visibility. Therefore, we probably should not require the autopilot system to be robust to such conditions. Now we ask the question, how should we evaluate the robustness of the the car’s autopilot to severe weather conditions?\nExisting methods for evaluating the robustness of a machine learning model to perturbed inputs (e.g. images that have been corrupted due to severe weather) are largely based on one of two notions. Average-case robustness, measures the model’s average performance on randomly sampled perturbations. In the autopilot example, for instance, we could randomly sample a bunch of images from all days recorded snow precipitation, and measure the average accuracy of the traffic light detection on those days. If most of those samples look like the first image shown above, we should expect the system’s average robustness to be pretty good. This notion of robustness, however, doesn’t tell us much about how our autopilot system will operate on more extreme conditions as depicted in the second and third images.\nAlternatively, worst-case robustness, or adversarial robustness, measures the model’s worst-case performance across all possible perturbations. For example, the worst-case performance of the autopilot system might be the result of navigating in the conditions depicted by the third image, displaying the snow squall. In this case, we should expect the system’s worst-case robustness to be pretty bad. But as we mentioned previously, we may not care so much if the system is able to navigate the worst-case conditions shown in the third image.\nSo then, how do we best measure the robustness of the system to conditions like those shown in the second image, i.e. conditions worse than average, but not the worst possible conditions? In this blog post, we present an alternative method for evaluating the test-time performance of machine learning models that measures robustness between the worst and average case, or intermediate robustness.\nA simple example: robustness to Gaussian noise\nTo further motivate the notion of intermediate robustness, consider the simple scenario in which we are interested in evaluating the robustness of an image classification model to Gaussian noise applied to the input images. The image below is a sample from the ImageNet validation dataset, which an image classifier trained on the ImageNet training dataset correctly classifies as “pizza”.\n\nGiven ten thousand random samples of Gaussian noise, the model classifies 97% of these noised images correctly, including the image below. Given the model correctly classifies a large majority of the randomly perturbed images, evaluating according to average-case robustness will place most weight on “easy” noise samples like this image.\n\nThe following image shown below illustrates an example of a randomly noised image that the model incorrectly classifies as “soup bowl”. Evaluating according to average-case robustness will place not put much weight on these samples that are harder for the model to classify correctly.\n\nWhat if we want to evaluate the model’s robustness on a stricter level than average-case robustness? Evaluating the image classifier according to worst-case robustness doesn’t make much sense for this particular noise distribution, because the worst-case noise could be an arbitrarily large amount of noise with extremely low probability due to the Gaussian distribution being unbounded. A more practical evaluation of robustness would consider something stricter than simply average performance on random perturbations, but not quite as strict as adversarial robustness, which is exactly what our intermediate robustness metric enables.\nAn intermediate robustness metric\nWe’ll now go into the details of how we formulate an intermediate robustness metric. We start by observing that we can naturally generalize average-case and worst-case robustness under one framework. To show this, we will make use of the mathematical definition of an \\( L^p \\)-norm of a function \\( f \\) on a measure space \\( X \\): \\( ||f||_p = (\\int_X |f|^p )^{(1/p)} \\). However, to differentiate this from the use of \\( \\ell_p \\)-norm balls as perturbation sets in adversarial robustness, we will from here on out refer this definition as a \\(q \\)-norm of a function. Ultimately, average and worst-case robustness can be generalized by taking the \\( q \\)-norm of the loss function over the perturbation distribution, where the loss just measures how well the model performs on the perturbed data. The setting of \\( q=1 \\) results in average-case robustness, whereas the setting of \\( q = \\infty \\) results in worst-case robustness, because by definition the \\( L^\\infty \\)-norm is given by the pointwise maximum of a function. Then, any value of \\( q \\) between \\( 1 \\) and \\( \\infty \\) results in intermediate robustness. This is more formally written below:\n\nDefine a neural network \\( h \\) with parameters \\( \\theta \\), and a loss function \\( \\ell \\) that measures how different the model predictions are from the true label \\( y \\) given an input \\( x \\). Consider we are interested in measuring the robustness of this model to perturbations \\( \\delta \\) from some perturbation distribution with density \\( \\mu \\). Now consider the following expectation over the \\( q \\)-norm of the loss according to this perturbation density,\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{D}} \\Big[ ||\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)||_{\\mu, q} \\Big], $$\nwhere the \\( q \\)-norm of the loss with perturbation density \\( \\mu \\) is the following:\n$$ ||\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)||_{\\mu, q} = \\mathbf{E}_{\\delta \\sim \\mu} [|\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)|^q]^{1/q} = \\Big( \\int |\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)|^q \\mu(\\delta)d\\delta) \\Big)^{1/q}.$$\nAssuming a smooth, non-negative loss function, this expectation corresponds to the expected loss on random perturbations (average-case) when \\( q = 1 \\),\n$$ || \\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y) ||_{\\mu, 1} = \\mathbf{E}_{\\delta \\sim \\mu} [\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)], $$\nand the expected maximum loss over all possible perturbations (worst-case) when \\( q = \\infty \\),\n$$ || \\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y) ||_{\\mu, \\infty} = \\text{max}_{\\delta \\in \\text{Supp}(\\mu)}[\\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta), y)].$$\n\n&nbsp;\nIntuitively, as we increase \\( q \\), more emphasis will be placed on high loss values, as the losses become more strongly “peaked” due to the exponent of \\( q \\). And so by increasing \\(q \\) from \\( 1 \\) to \\( \\infty \\), we enable a full spectrum of intermediate robustness measurements that are increasingly strict by placing more weight on high loss values. This formulation allows us to evaluate a model’s robustness in a wide range between the two extremes of average and worst case performance.\nApproximating the metric using path sampling\nIn most cases, we have to approximate the metric we just defined, which cannot be calculated exactly because it requires computing a high-dimensional integral over the perturbation space. Ultimately, we approximate the integral using the path sampling method [Gelman and Meng, 1998], but to motivate why this is important, we’ll first give an example of a naive, yet suboptimal, way of estimating the integral.\nMonte Carlo estimator\nFor illustration purposes, let’s consider approximating the integral \\( \\int_a^b f(x)^q \\mu(x)dx \\) for an arbitrary function \\( f \\) and probability density \\( \\mu \\). Recall that the integral of a function can be interpreted as calculating the area below the function’s curve. We could pick a random sample \\( x \\), evaluate the function \\( f(x)^q \\) at \\( x \\) and multiply by \\( (b-a ) \\) to estimate the area. However, using just one sample, this will likely underestimate or overestimate the area. If we instead pick many samples and take the average of their estimates, with enough samples this theoretically should eventually converge to something close to the desired integral. This is known as the Monte Carlo estimator, and can be visualized in the plot below for the function \\( f(x)^q \\) with \\( q = 1 \\).\n\nNow let’s see what this plot looks like for \\( q=2 \\). We see that values of \\( x \\) for which the value \\( f(x) \\) is large make a larger contribution to the integral. However, because these values of \\( x \\) have a lower probability of being sampled, random sampling places a disproportionate amount of weight on estimates from \\( x \\) with lower values of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nAs we continue to increase the value of \\( q \\), as shown in the plot below for \\( q=3 \\), we can see that Monte Carlo sampling will be increasingly insufficient to approximate this integral well.\n\nTranslating this back to our integral of interest, when the perturbation density is concentrated in a region with low loss values, the Monte Carlo estimator will be less capable of producing an accurate approximation of the integral when we want to evaluate intermediate robustness for larger values of \\( q \\).\nPath sampling estimator\nTo better approximate the integral for large values of \\( q \\), we need to sample perturbations that contribute more largely to the integral (e.g. result in higher loss values) more frequently. Path sampling is one method that boosts the frequency of more “important” samples by sampling from a “path” of alternative densities that encourages samples where the integrand is large.\nThe path sampling estimator of the intermediate robustness metric ultimately takes the form of the geometric mean of the losses given the sampled perturbations from these alternative densities, which are annealed to follow an increasingly “peaked” distribution. Practically, these samples can be drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The path sampling estimator is written more formally below:\n\nConsider the following class of densities,\n$$ p(\\delta|t) \\propto \\ell(h_\\theta(x+\\delta),y)^t \\mu(\\delta),$$\nand construct a path by interpolating \\( t^{(i)} \\) between 0 and \\( q \\) and sampling a perturbation \\( \\delta^{(i)} \\) from \\( p(\\delta|t^{(i)}) \\) using MCMC. Then, the path sampling estimator of the intermediate robustness metric is the following geometric mean,\n$$ \\hat{Z}_\\text{Path sampling} := \\Big( \\prod_{i=1}^m \\ell \\big( h_\\theta(x+\\delta^{(i)}), y \\big) \\Big)^{1/m}.$$\n\nEvaluating the intermediate robustness of an image classifier\nNow that we have introduced a metric for evaluating the intermediate robustness of a model, along with methods for approximating this metric, let’s evaluate the performance of a model at different robustness levels. We’ll see that the intermediate robustness metric interpolates between measurements of average and the worst-case robustness, providing a multitude of additional ways in which we can measure a model’s robustness, and we’ll empirically show the advantage of the path sampling estimator over the Monte Carlo estimator.\nBecause it is a setting commonly considered in the adversarial (worst-case) robustness literature, consider evaluating the robustness of an image classifier to perturbations \\( \\delta \\) uniformly distributed within the \\( \\ell_\\infty \\)-norm ball with radius \\( \\epsilon \\) (i.e. each component of \\( \\delta \\) is uniformly distributed between \\( [-\\epsilon, \\epsilon] \\)).\nIn the figure below, we plot the test-time performance of an image classifier, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using our intermediate robustness metric for different values of \\( q \\).\n\nThis figure shows that our proposed intermediate robustness metric does indeed capture the gap between the two existing robustness metrics, effectively interpolating between average-case robustness (\\( q=1 \\)) and worst-case (adversarial) robustness measurements when increasing the value of \\( q \\) from left to right.\nWe can also compare the Monte Carlo and path sampling estimators for different values of \\( q \\). This figure illustrates that while both of the approximation methods result in a similar estimate for \\( q=1 \\), for larger values of \\( q \\), path sampling results in a higher, more accurate estimate of the intermediate robustness metric, more closely approaching the adversarial loss, when compared to Monte Carlo sampling.\nThe benefit of the path sampling estimator can be further shown in the figure below, which plots the convergence of the Monte Carlo sampling and path sampling estimates of the intermediate robustness metric given an increasing number of samples.\nConvergence with \\( q=1 \\)Convergence with \\( q=100 \\)\n\n\nAgain, when approximating the robustness metric for \\( q=1 \\), shown on the left, both estimators converge to the same value with relatively few iterations. However, when approximating the intermediate robustness metric for \\( q=100 \\), shown on the right, the Monte Carlo sampler results in estimates that are consistently lower and less accurate than those of path sampling, even with a large number of samples.\nTraining for different levels of robustness\nWe can also train machine learning models according to specific levels of robustness by choosing a value of \\( q \\) and minimizing the intermediate robustness objective. However, training intermediate robust models is computationally challenging because a non-trivial number of perturbation samples is needed to accurately estimate the robustness objective, even when using the path sampling method. While evaluating models simply requires one iteration over the test dataset, training requires multiple iterations over the training dataset, resulting in an extremely expensive procedure when effectively multiplying the dataset size by the number of perturbaton samples.\nDue to this computational complexity, we train an image classifier on the simpler MNIST dataset (using the same perturbation set) to minimize the intermediate robustness objective for different values of \\( q \\) (approximated using path sampling). We train one model with \\( q=1 \\), which is just like training with data augmentation (training on randomly sampled perturbations), and we train one model with \\( q=100 \\), which is somewhere in between training with data augmentation and adversarial training (training on worst-case perturbations).\nWe evaluate the intermediate and adversarial robustness of each of the final trained models, the results of which can be seen in the figure below.\nTraining with \\( q=1 \\)Training with \\( q=100 \\)\n\n\nWhile the model trained with \\( q=1 \\), shown on the left, and the model trained with \\( q=100 \\), shown on the right, have similar performance when evaluated at less strict robustness levels, \\( q=1 \\) and \\( q=10 \\), the model trained with \\( q=100 \\) is much more robust when comparing the stricter \\( q=1000 \\) and adversarial robustness measurements.\nUltimately, the main takeaway from training using the proposed intermediate robustness objective is that the choice of \\( q \\) allows for fine-grained control over the desired level of robustness, rather than being restricted to average-case or worst-case objectives.\nConclusion\nWe’ve introduced a new robustness metric that allows for evaluating a machine learning model’s intermediate robustness, bridging the gap between evaluating robustness to random perturbations and robustness to worst-case perturbations. This intermediate robustness metric generalizes average-case and worst-case notions of robustness under the same framework as functional \\( q \\)-norms of the loss function over the perturbation distribution. We introduced a method for approximating this metric using path sampling, which results in a more accurate estimate of the metric compared to naive Monte Carlo sampling when evaluating at robustness levels approaching adversarial robustness. Empirically we showed that by evaluating an image classifier on additive noise perturbations, the proposed intermediate robustness metric enables a broader spectrum of robustness measurements, between the least strict notion of average performance on random perturbations and the most conservative notion of adversarial robustness. Finally, we highlighted the potential ability to train for specific levels of robustness using intermediate-\\( q \\) robustness as a training objective.

Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) present these multimodal data systems in a unified view by defining multiple types of nodes and edges — for instance, e-commerce networks with (user, product, review) nodes or video platforms with (channel, user, video, comment) nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings, which summarize each node’s heterogeneous local structure into a vector. Unfortunately, there is a label imbalance issue between different node types in real-world HGs. For instance, publicly available content node types such as product nodes are abundantly labeled, whereas labels for user or account nodes may not be available due to privacy restrictions. Because of this, label-scarce node types cannot exploit HGNNs, hampering the broader applicability of HGNNs.\nIn this blog, we introduce how to pre-train an HGNN model on label-abundant node types and then transfer the model to label-scarce node types using relational information given in HGs. You can find details of the work in our paper “Zero-shot Transfer Learning within a Heterogeneous Graph via Knowledge Transfer Networks” [1], presented at NeurIPS 2022.\nWhat is a heterogeneous graph (HG)?\n\n\nFigure 1. E-commerce heterogeneous graph: Can we transfer knowledge from label-abundant node types (e.g., products) to zero-labeled node types (e.g., users) through relational information given in a heterogeneous graph?\n\n\nAn HG is composed of multiple node and edge types. Figure 1 shows an e-commerce network presented as an HG. In e-commerce, “users” purchase “products” and write “reviews”. HG presents this ecosystem using three node types (“user”, “product”, “review”) and three edge types (“user-buy-product”, “user-write-review”, review-on-product”). Individual products, users, and reviews are then presented as nodes and their relationships as edges in the HG with the corresponding node/edge types.\nIn addition to all relational information, HGs are commonly provided with input node attributes that summarize each node’s information. For instance, product nodes could have product images as input node attributes, while review nodes could have review texts as their input attributes. As in the example, input node attributes could have different modalities across different node types.  The goal is to predict node labels on each node, such as the category of each product or the category each user is most interested in.\nIn the following section, we introduce the main challenge we face while training HGNNs to predict labels using input node attributes and relational information from HGs.\nHeterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) and label scarcity issues\nHGNNs compute node embeddings that summarize each node’s local graph structures including the node and its neighbor’s input attribute distributions. Node embeddings are then fed into a classifier to predict each node’s label. To train an HGNN model and a classifier to predict labels for a specific node type, we require a good amount of labels for the node type.\nA common issue in real-world applications of deep learning is label scarcity. With their diverse node types, HGNNs are even more likely to face this challenge. For instance, publicly available content node types are abundantly labeled, whereas labels for user nodes may not be available due to privacy restrictions. This means that in most standard training settings, HGNN models can only learn to make good inferences for a few label-abundant node types and can usually not make any inferences for the remaining node types, given the absence of any labels for them.\nTo solve this label scarcity issue, we will use a technique called zero-shot transfer learning that improves the performance of a model on a zero-labeled domain.\nTransfer Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs\nTo improve the performance on a zero-labeled “target” domain, transfer learning exploits the knowledge earned from a related “source” domain, which has adequate labeled data. For instance, transfer learning on heterogeneous graphs first trains an HGNN model on the source domain using their labels, then reuses the HGNN model on the target domain.\nIn order to apply transfer learning on heterogeneous graphs to solve the label scarcity issue we described above, it is clear the target domain should be the zero-labeled node types. The question remained of what would be the source domain. Previous works commonly set the source domain as the same type of nodes but located in an external HG, assuming those nodes are abundantly labeled (Figure 2). For instance, the source domain is user nodes in the Yelp review graph, while the target domain is user nodes in the Amazon e-commerce graph. This approach, also known as graph-to-graph transfer learning, pre-trains an HGNN model on the external HG and then runs the model on the original label-scarce HG [2, 3].\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of graph-to-graph transfer learning on heterogeneous graph.\n\n\nHowever, this approach is not applicable in many real-world scenarios for three reasons. First, any external HG that could be used in a graph-to-graph transfer learning setting would almost surely be proprietary, thereby, making it hard to get access to. Second, even if practitioners could obtain access to an external HG, it is unlikely that the distribution of the external HG would match our target HG well enough to apply transfer learning. Finally, node types suffering from label scarcity are likely to suffer the same issue on other HGs. For instance, user nodes on the external HG also have scarce labels with privacy constraints.\nOur approach: transfer learning between node types within a heterogeneous graph\nTo overcome the limitation of usage of external HGs for transfer learning, we introduce a practical source domain, other node types with abundant labels located on the same HG. Instead of using extra HGs, we transfer knowledge across different types of nodes within a single HG assumed to be fully owned by the practitioners. More specifically, we first pre-train an HGNN model and a classifier on a label-abundant “source” node type. Then, we reuse the models on the zero-labeled “target” node types located in the same HG without additional finetuning. The one requirement for this approach is that the source and target node types share the same label set. This requirement is frequently satisfied in real-world settings. For instance, product nodes have a label set describing product categories, and user nodes share the same label set describing their favorite shopping categories in e-commerce HGs.\nMain technical challenge\nWe now describe the main challenge in realizing our approach. We cannot directly reuse the pretrained HGNN and classifier on the target node type as described above because HGNN maps the source and target embeddings into the different embedding spaces.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The L2 norm of gradients passed to each module in the HGNN while pretraining on the source node type. Green and Red lines show large amounts of gradients passed to source node type-specific modules, while blue and orange lines show little or no gradients passed to target type-specific modules.\n\n\nThis happens because of one crucial characteristic of HGNNs — HGNNs are composed of modules specialized to each node type and use distinct sets of modules to compute embeddings for each node type. During pretraining HGNNs on the source node type, modules specialized to the source node type are well-trained, while modules specialized to the target node are untrained or under-trained. In Figure 3, we can observe the source modules (green and red lines) receive high L2 norms of gradients during pretraining. On the other hand, because of the specialization, the target modules (orange and blue lines) receive little or no gradients. With under-trained modules for the target node type, the pretrained HGNN model outputs poor node embeddings for the target node type, and, consequently, poor performance on the node prediction task.\nKTN: Trainable Cross-Type Transfer Learning for HGNNs\nNow, we introduce a method to transform the under-trained poor embeddings of the target node type to follow source embeddings. This allows us to reuse the classifier that was trained on source node types. In order to derive the transformation in a principled manner, let us look into how HGNNs compute node embeddings and analyze the relationship between source and target embeddings.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. (left) In HGNNs, the final L-layer node embeddings for both source and target types are computed using the same input, the previous (L-1)-layer’s node embeddings. (right) The L-layer node embeddings of the source type (product, blue) can be represented by the L-layer node embeddings of the target type (user, red) using (L-1)-layer node embeddings as intermediate values.\n\n\nIn each layer, HGNNs aggregate connected nodes’ embeddings from the previous layer to update each target node’s embeddings. Node embeddings for both source and target node types are updated using the same input: the previous layer’s node embeddings of any connected node types (Figure 4, left). This means that they can be represented by each other using the previous layer embeddings as intermediate values (Figure 4, right).\nWe prove there is a mapping matrix from the target domain to the source domain, which is defined by HGNN parameters (Theorem 1 in [1]). Based on this theorem, we introduce an auxiliary network, named Knowledge Transfer Networks (KTN), that learns the mapping matrix from scratch during pretraining HGNN on the source domain. At test time, we first compute target embeddings using the pretrained HGNN, then map the target embeddings to the source domain using our trained KTN. Finally, we can reuse the classifier with transformed target embeddings.\nExperimental results\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Zero-shot transfer learning performance measured in NDCG on Open Academic Graph (OAG) and Pubmed datasets. Higher is better. Our proposed method KTN (red bar) shows the highest accuracy among all baselines.\n\n\nTo examine the effectiveness of our proposed KTN, we ran 18 different zero-shot transfer learning tasks on two public heterogeneous graphs, Open Academic Graph [4] and Pubmed [5]. We compare KTN with 8 state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. We show our results in Figure 5. Our proposed method KTN consistently outperforms all baselines on all tasks by up to 73.3%. The naive approach we discussed earlier — reuse the pretrained models directly on the target domain without any transfer learning — is presented as blue bar. We see our method KTN provides relative gains of up to 340% higher than the naive approach without using any labels from the target domain.\n\n\n\nFigure 6. KTN can be applied to 6 different HGNN models and improve their zero-shot performance on target domains. Performance is measured in NDCG. Higher is better.\n\n\nKTN can be applied to almost all HGNN models that have node/edge type-specific modules and improve their zero-shot performance on target domains. In Figure 6, KTN improves accuracy on zero-labeled node types across 6 different HGNN models by up to 960%.\nTakeaway:\nVarious real-world applications can be presented as heterogeneous graphs. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) are an effective technique for summarizing heterogeneous graphs into concise embeddings. However, label scarcity issues on certain types of nodes have prevented the broader application of HGNNs. In this post, we introduced KTN, the first cross-type transfer learning method designed for HGNNs.

Many businesses are adopting public cloud services to simplify data center management or leverage the scalability and elasticity offered by these providers.\nA pressing question that accompanies this shift to public cloud adoption is how to optimize the overall cost of utilizing cloud resources. While researchers have recently delved into cost optimization for virtual machine (VM) instances used in computational workloads, there has been limited focus on optimizing storage choices. Frequently, companies require high-performance storage clusters to efficiently operate their workloads in public clouds. However, the costs associated with these storage clusters cannot be underestimated, given that VMs and block storage options can strain budgets.\nThus, companies need to carefully select resources for storage clusters to reduce their Total Cost of Ownership. If organizations opt for only inexpensive resources to minimize costs, their storage clusters may fail to meet performance requirements. Conversely, selecting solely high-performance Virtual Machines and storage types can lead to substantial spending compared to an optimized resource selection approach.\nNonetheless, choosing the cost-efficient set of resources for storage clusters in public clouds remains a challenging task and there is no existing system that helps this provisioning decision. The multitude of available VM and storage types adds complexity. For instance, AWS alone offers over a hundred different instance types and various block storage options, including locally attached (LocalSSD) and remotely disaggregated (EBS). Each resource option comes with distinct pricing and performance models, and the performance also varies based on workload characteristics. This necessitates a deep understanding of both cloud resource attributes and workload characteristics to make informed selections. If we factor in the potential use of heterogeneous storage cluster configurations, the problem’s search space becomes significantly larger and more intricate.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce Mimir, a resource auto-selection tool designed to identify the most cost-efficient set of resources for storage clusters in public clouds, all while meeting specified performance requirements. Our system assesses all available VM types, block storage options, and even combinations of these options (heterogeneous configurations) to determine the optimal solution. As a result, Mimir can yield storage cluster configurations up to 81% cheaper than those generated by the current state-of-the-art resource auto-selection tools. In our evaluations, we demonstrate that Mimir can also serve as a resource selector for mixed workloads (comprising multiple workloads with distinct characteristics) and dynamic workloads, efficiently identifying cost-effective cluster configurations within a reasonable time.\nChallenges: navigating diverse resource options and heterogeneity\nChallenge 1: diverse storage options’ characteristics\nPublic cloud providers have established unique performance characteristics for their block storage options, setting them apart from traditional solutions like SSDs and HDDs. Workload attributes such as access pattern (random/sequential), read ratio, and I/O unit size can exert significant influence on the performance of cloud block storage. Overlooking these factors or assuming that cloud storage behaves analogously to traditional storage can result in erroneous storage cluster configurations. To illustrate this, we present two examples showcasing how workload characteristics impact storage performance.\n\n(a) by I/O unit size(b) by read ratio\n\nFig. 1: Performance characteristics of public cloud storage volume types by (a) I/O unit size and (b) workload read ratio. In (a), both volume types have throughput limits defined by AWS (horizontal lines).\nIn our tests, we employed the fio benchmark to assess cloud block storage performance on AWS, using three different storage types: local NVMe SSD, remote SSD (gp2), and remote HDD (st1). We varied access patterns, read ratios, and I/O unit sizes. Fig. 1 provides insights into the characteristics of 1 TiB gp2 and 1 TiB st1 volumes, each having performance of 3000 IOPS and 40 MiB/s following the performance model provided by AWS, along with local SSD attached to i3.xlarge.\nFig. 1(a) shows how performance characteristics vary with I/O unit size and access pattern for each storage type. For gp2 performance, which is defined in IOPS, increasing the I/O unit size results in higher throughput, eventually reaching the maximum limit set by AWS. Also, it remains consistent regardless of the access pattern. In contrast, st1’s performance, defined in MiB/s, should ideally maintain a throughput of 40 MB/s regardless of the I/O unit size. However, it exhibits reduced throughput for workloads featuring random access patterns and I/O units smaller than 1 MiB, different to the behavior observed with sequential accesses.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we examine the impact of read ratios on each volume type’s throughput. EBS volumes remain unaffected by the read ratio, as it lies outside their performance models. Conversely, local SSD exhibits considerably higher throughput than EBS and is notably influenced by the read ratio.\nAs highlighted above, in public clouds, storage performance characteristics differ from traditional storage. For instance, remote SSD throughput remains consistent regardless of read-to-write ratios, while performance of different storage options changes differently for I/O unit size changes. This can confuse users configuring cloud storage clusters, as they may erroneously assume that cloud storage exhibit conventional storage behavior. However, by accurately considering these pricing and performance models, Mimir can mathematically deduce performance specifications from allocated resources, aiding in cost-efficient cloud storage configurations that meet performance needs.\nIt is worth to note that local SSD’s highest throughput in Fig. 1 does not always make it the best choice. Throughput of each storage option varies with its configuration; larger gp2 and st1 volumes can outperform local SSD. st1 and gp2 come with lower per-byte costs, making them cost-efficient alternatives when high throughput is not crucial.\nChallenge 2: heterogeneity is important for cost-efficiency\nOne easy way of selecting resources for a storage cluster in the public cloud is configuring a homogeneous storage cluster by using a single storage option.\nHowever, we found that there is no single storage option that is the most cost-efficient for every workload, and sometimes, even a mix of storage options is needed to minimize the cost.\n\nFig. 2: No volume type is most cost-efficient for every workload, and a mix of volume types may be the most cost-effective option.\nFig. 2 demonstrates the need to consider various volume types and configurations for selecting a cost-efficient Virtual Storage Cluster (VSC) configuration. For each of the three workloads, it shows the cost for the best VSC configuration under three constraints: using only local SSD volume types, only remote storage (EBS) volume types, and arbitrary mixes of both.\nFor Workload 1, which demands high storage throughput per GB of data, opting for EBS volume types leads to over-provisioning capacity, making it an expensive choice due to the 3 IOPS per provisioned-GB limit. Conversely, Workload 2, with lower storage throughput requirements, renders local SSD an expensive option due to over-provisioning storage performance. Workload 3 combines varying performance needs, necessitating a mix of storage options to minimize costs.\nTherefore, it is crucial to consider a heterogeneous VSC configuration for the cost-efficiency. However, this introduces complexity, making it impractical to explore the search space using naive methods. So users can use Mimir as a solution to efficiently navigate this complex search space by using dynamic programming and integer-linear programming.\nMimir: resource auto-selector for storage cluster in public clouds\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce Mimir, a resource auto-selector that identifies the cost-efficient set of VMs and storage volumes for a storage cluster. Mimir takes into account workload characteristics (such as read/write request ratio and data access locality) and user-defined requirements (including request rate and capacity). Next, we will provide an overview of Mimir’s workflow and delve into our main optimization algorithm.\nMimir design and workflow\nFig. 3 outlines Mimir’s workflow, which begins by inputting characteristics from multiple workloads requiring cluster storage. Each storage cluster’s workload profiler profiles these attributes, and the Resource Profiler assesses them to determine resource needs for cost-effective cloud operations. This involves resource utilization profiling using micro-benchmarks, considering given data access patterns like request rate, access locality, and read/write ratios. The Resource Predictor uses this resource profiling data to identify efficient container sizes (i.e., storage/network bandwidth, CPU count, memory) for each workload, as Mimir utilizes containers to run multiple storage servers in the same VM with resource isolation. Finally, the VSC Cost Optimizer combines these insights with the public cloud’s cost model to optimize the Virtual Storage Cluster (VSC) configuration for the distributed storage system.\n\nFig. 3: Mimir’s workflow for optimizing the price of public cloud resources. Initially, Mimir profiles the provided workloads, learning the precise resource requirements (such as CPU and memory). Using this trained module and a cost model encompassing public cloud resources, the VSC Cost Optimizer then identifies the most cost-efficient Virtual Storage Cluster (VSC) configuration.\nMimir assumes that users provide or profile the workload characteristics, which the system uses as input for its optimization process. This modular approach makes Mimir adaptable to any storage system capable of profiling sufficient workload information. Next, we provide a brief overview of the optimization algorithm used by Mimir to minimize costs for the given workload characteristics. Further details regarding other components, such as the Resource Profiler and Resource Predictor, can be found in our paper.\nOptimization algorithm: dynamic programming\nThe VSC Cost Optimizer addresses the following question: What resource configuration minimizes costs while meeting performance requirements and accommodating storage workload characteristics?\nIn this optimization problem, we identified an optimal substructure property. This means that if Mimir determines the most cost-efficient virtual storage cluster configuration for the given workloads, then any subset of storage servers from the entire cluster (a sub-cluster) must also represent the cost-efficient configuration for the workloads running on that specific sub-cluster.\n\nFig. 4: Mimir’s optimization problem has an optimal substructure property. If we find the most cost-efficient configuration for the entire virtual storage cluster, then any sub-cluster of that configuration must also be cost-efficient for the portion of data stored within that sub-cluster.\nFigure 4 exemplifies the optimal substructure property. Suppose Machines 1-4 represent the most cost-efficient VSC configuration for a given workload. We contend that any sub-cluster should also be the most cost-efficient for the portion of the workload it handles. To prove this, we use a proof by contradiction. Let’s assume that Machines 1 and 2 are not the most cost-efficient sub-cluster configuration for 3/10 of the workload. This would imply the existence of another sub-cluster (in this case, Machine 5) that’s cheaper than Machines 1 and 2. However, this contradicts the fact that Machines 1-4 (total VSC cost: $28) constitute the most cost-efficient VSC configuration for the entire workload, given that a cheaper configuration involving Machines 3-5 (total VSC cost: $26) exists.\nBased on the optimal substructure property, we use dynamic programming to break down a large search space into manageable segments. For a more in-depth understanding of our approach, including how we use mixed-integer programming for the base case and how Mimir integrates other components (e.g., resource profiler, resource predictor, and cost model) into its optimization algorithm, please refer to our paper.\nMimir can find up to 81% cheaper storage cluster over SOTA\nWe evaluated Mimir using Apache BookKeeper as the distributed storage backend and six different Meta’s RocksDB (MR) key-value workloads.\nThe results of our evaluation demonstrate significant cost savings achieved by Mimir compared to state-of-the-art solutions, showing its ability to consider a wide range of volume types. We compared Mimir to three baseline configurations, each focusing on a limited subset of instance or storage types, in contrast to Mimir’s comprehensive consideration of all instance and block storage types:\n\ni3.xlarge-only: The simplest way to configure a VSC is using a single instance type (storage-optimized instance, i3.xlarge) and determining the number of instances based on the storage server performance.\nMimir-LocalOnly: Another way is to use only instance types that have local SSDs, including some compute or memory optimized instance types like m5d, c5d, and r5d.\nMimir-EBSonly/OptimusCloud-like: Yet another way of configuring VSC is using only EBS volumes that can persist data independently from the instance status, but if the workload requires high-performance, it can be more expensive\nthan local SSD. OptimusCloud, the previous work we consider as the state-of-the-art, restricts the volume type to EBS volumes because of their persistent nature, but our results show that this approach is often much more costly.\n\n\nFig. 5: The cost-efficiency analysis of the optimization results of the workloads of Meta’s RocksDB key-value workloads. Throughput-intensive workloads (MR-A,C,E,F) prefer local SSD as its storage type. In contrast, other\nworkloads (MR-B,D) that do not require high throughput prefer EBS volume to local SSD.\nFig. 5 shows the VSC costs of the most cost-efficient VSC configurations under different resource constraints. Overall, Mimir successfully identifies the most cost-efficient VSC configuration for any workload in Fig. 5, and achieves up to 81% cost savings compared to the OptimusCloud-like baseline. We also demonstrate that depending on the workload characteristics, different workloads prefer different storage types to store data cost-efficiently.\nFor instance, MR-D, a capacity-intensive workload, does not require high performance. Thus, local SSD proves costly as it under-utilizes its storage bandwidth, and gp2’s throughput (3 IOPS per provisioned GiB) suffices for MR-D.\nConversely, MR-F, with the second highest throughput needs among the six workloads, benefits from local SSD, making Mimir-LocalOnly more cost-efficient than Mimir-EBSonly. Interestingly, for MR-F, compute-optimized instance types like c5d are more economical than storage-optimized i3.xlarge. This is because MR-F demands high computing power for its high data request rate. This evaluation implies that not only considering various storage options, but also selecting the right instance type is important.\nOur paper also covers additional evaluations, including the optimization overhead and Mimir’s effectiveness for dynamic workloads. For comprehensive details, please refer to our research paper.\nConclusion\nMimir finds the cost-efficient virtual storage cluster configurations for distributed storage backends.\nBy using provided workload information and performance requirements, Mimir predicts resource requirements and explores the complex, heterogeneous set of block storage offerings to identify the lowest cost VSC configuration that satisfies the customer’s need.\nExperiments show that no single allocation type is best for all workloads and that a mix of allocation types is the best choice for some workloads.\nCompared to a state-of-the-art approach, Mimir finds the VSC configurations that satisfy requirements at up to 81% lower cost for Meta’s RocksDB workloads.\nYou can find more detailed information in our published paper.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/mimir/","title":"Mimir: Finding cost-efficient storage configurations in the public cloud"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/provably-safe-sandboxing-wasm/":{"body":"\nWhat if you could run untrusted code and still be able to sleep at night, safe and sound?\n\n\nDisclaimer: our award-winning work [1] can only calm your unsafe-software related fears; we recommend complementing this by additionally checking for monsters under your bed, and leaving a night light on, for any fears of things that go bump in the night.\n\n\nFigure 1: Intra-process sandboxing\n\nWhether you want to include third party libraries in your code, support software plugins, use a smart content delivery network, or just browse the Web, you might need to execute untrusted code, which creates a risk that it will compromise its environment. Intra-process software sandboxing (Figure 1), such as with Software Fault Isolation (SFI), is a useful primitive that allows for safe and lightweight execution of such untrusted code in the same process as its environment. Unfortunately, despite being a well-studied technique with a rich and long history, previous efforts to deploy it in production have failed, due to technical and marketplace hurdles, such as requiring access to original source code, complex binary rewriting, or only being supported by a single vendor.\nWebAssembly (Wasm) is ideally positioned to provide this crucial primitive and support such applications, since Wasm promises both safety and performance, while serving as a popular compiler target for many high-level languages. As a virtual architecture designed with sandboxing in mind, it has clean, succinct, and well-defined semantics, allowing for safe execution of high-performance code on the Web. However, this same design can also benefit non-Web applications, since the Wasm standard explicitly separates the core Wasm language from the specific API provided to each Wasm module by the runtime or other modules. For example, instead of offering a Web-oriented API, (say) for manipulating the DOM, many runtimes offer the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) API to run Wasm beyond the Web. All of this has made Wasm an attractive compilation target, and compilers for most popular languages, such as C, C++, Rust, Java, Go, C#, PHP, Python, TypeScript, Zig, and Kotlin, now support it as a target. Thus, a single compiler from Wasm to executable code is sufficient to immediately support sandboxed code execution for all such languages. This makes Wasm an attractive narrow waist to provide high-performance lightweight sandboxing.\nHowever, Wasm’s safety guarantees are only as strong as the implementation that enforces them. While Wasm might seem to immediately provide sandboxing, note that the actual implementation of the compiler from Wasm is a critical part of the trusted computing base (TCB) for the guarantee of sandboxing. In particular, any bug in the compiler could threaten the sandboxing protections, and indeed such bugs have been found in existing runtimes, and would lead to arbitrary code execution by an adversary. For example, using carefully crafted Wasm modules, an attacker could achieve:\n\na memory-out-of-bounds read in Safari/WebKit using a logic bug (CVE-2018-4222),\nmemory corruption in Chrome/V8 using an integer overflow bug (CVE-2018-6092),\nan arbitrary memory read in Chrome/V8 using a parsing bug (CVE-2017-5088),\narbitrary code execution in Safari/WebKit using an integer overflow bug (CVE-2021-30734),\na sandbox escape in both Lucet [6] and Wasmtime [7] using an optimization bug (CVE-2021-32629),\na memory-out-of-bounds read/write in Wasmtime (CVE-2023-26489),\nand many others.\n\nA plausible explanation for such disastrous sandbox-compromising bugs—even in code designed with sandboxing as an explicit focus, is that the correct (let alone secure) implementation of high-performance compilers is difficult and remains an active area of research, despite decades of work.\nUpon reviewing the design space for executing Wasm code, we identified a crucial gap: Wasm implementations that provide both strong security and high performance. In our work, we thus propose, explore, and implement two distinct techniques, with varying performance and development complexity, which guarantee safe sandboxing using provably-safe compilers. The first draws on traditional formal methods to produce mathematical, machine-checked proofs of safety. The second carefully embeds Wasm semantics in safe Rust code such that the Rust compiler can emit safe executable code with good performance. We describe each of these techniques in the upcoming sections, but additionally refer the interested reader to our paper [1] for further details.\nvWasm: A Formally Verified Sandboxing Compiler\nThe first of our techniques, implemented as an open-source compiler, vWasm [2], achieves provably-safe sandboxing via formal verification. Formal verification of software consists of writing a formal (mathematical) statement of the property we wish to prove about the software, and then writing a formal proof that shows that this statement is true for our software. The proof is machine-checked and thus provides the highest degree of assurance in its correctness. In contrast to techniques such as software testing, fuzzing, and manual reviews, formal verification is able to reason about all execution paths, thereby accounting for any possible input. This means that behaviors like buffer overflows, use-after-frees, etc. are completely ruled out. We describe vWasm’s top-level property, as well as our proof strategy, shortly.\nOur choice of verification tool, F* [4], is a general-purpose functional programming language with effects, built for formal verification. Syntactically, it is closest to languages from the ML family (such as OCaml, F#, or SML). It has the full expressive power of dependent types, and has proof automation backed by Z3, an SMT solver. Code written in F* can be extracted to multiple languages, and for vWasm, we use F*’s OCaml extraction. Proofs are written within vWasm as a combination of pre-/post-conditions, extrinsic lemmas, intrinsic dependently-typed values, and layered effects.\nvWasm is implemented as a compiler from Wasm to x86-64 (abbreviated as x64 henceforth), but it is designed to keep most of its code and proofs generic with respect to the target architecture. Here, we describe the process of compiling to x64, but the techniques generalize in a straightforward way to other architectures such as ARM. In compiling from Wasm to x64, there are three important conceptual stages: (i) a frontend which compiles Wasm to an architecture-parametric intermediate representation (IR), (ii) a sandboxing pass which acts upon the architecture-parametric IR, and (iii) a printer which outputs the x64 assembly code.\nThe frontend for the compiler is both untrusted and unverified. This means that one neither needs to trust its correctness for the overall theorem statement to be true, nor does one need to write proofs about it. Note that this is in stark contrast with traditional compiler verification, such as with CompCert [5], where any stage of the compilation must either be trusted or verified. This means that we are free to use any compiler technology for the compiler’s frontend, including arbitrarily complicated optimizations, as long as it outputs code within our architecture-parametric IR. Since compiler optimization is orthogonal to our primary goal, for vWasm’s frontend, we implemented only a simple register allocator and a basic peep-hole optimizer. We leave other optimizations for future work.\nOn the other end of the compilation pipeline is the x64 assembly printer, which is trusted to be correct. This means it is included in vWasm’s overall TCB, but we note that the printer is largely a straightforward one-to-one translation of our IR to strings, making it fairly simple to audit.\nFinally, the sandboxing pass, which lies between the above two, is untrusted but verified to be correct. We define this formally below, but informally, this means that the sandboxing code has been proven (and the proof mechanically checked) to produce safely sandboxed code, given any input. Within the sandboxing pass, all accesses (reads or writes) into the Wasm module’s linear memory, indirect function call table, imports, globals, etc. are proven (sometimes after suitable transformations) to be safe. To prove sandbox safety, we additionally prove that the sandboxing pass also guarantees (a restricted form of) Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) that ensures that any checks performed for sandboxing cannot be bypassed, and thus must be obeyed.\nFormally reasoning about the safety of sandboxing requires first defining a machine model, and then defining what sandbox safety is in that model. Our machine model covers the subset of x64 targeted by the compiler. A simplified version of this model can be found in our paper, while the complete model can be found in our open-sourced code. We define the semantics for x64 as small-step semantics, allowing for reasoning about even potentially infinitely running code. Within this machine model, the program state contains an ok field, which is set to the value AllOk if and only if, until that point in execution, nothing invalid has occurred. Crucially, this also means that no accesses outside the memory allocated to the module have occurred. Sandboxing is safe if and only if, informally, starting from any initial AllOk state, executing the sandboxed code for any number of steps leads to an AllOk state.\nWritten more formally in F*, but still slightly simplified for easier reading:\n\n\nThis statement, written as pre- and post-conditions for the sandboxing pass sandbox_compile, shows that any code (c') output by the sandboxer is formally guaranteed via the machine-checked proof to be safe. The pass takes two arguments a (auxiliary data) and c (the input program), and a computationally-irrelevant argument s (the initial state of the program, which is used for reasoning in our proofs, but that is erased when running the compiler), and returns output code c' under the custom effect Err (which allows the compiler to quit early upon error, for example if it finds a call to a non-existent function).  The statement guarantees that as long as the pre-conditions in the requires clause are satisfied, the post-condition in the ensures clause provably holds on the produced output code. The pre-conditions say that the initial state must be safe, have a reasonable sandbox size, and start from a valid location in the code; if these conditions are met, the output code c' will be safe when executed for any number of steps n.\nThe proofs for this theorem span approximately 3,500 lines of F* code, not including the machine model or any of the supporting framework we built to write this proof. In total, vWasm consists of approximately 15,000 lines of F* code and proofs, and required approximately two person-years of development effort.\nrWasm: High-Performance Informally-Proven-Safe Sandboxing\nOur second technique, implemented as an open-source compiler, rWasm [3], achieves provably-safe sandboxing via a careful embedding of Wasm semantics into safe Rust, such that the Rust compiler can then emit high-performance, safe machine code. This approach provides multiple benefits, such as portability across architectures, performance that is competitive with other unsafe compilers, and the ability to introduce runtime extensions (such as inline reference monitors—IRMs) that can be optimized in-tandem with the executed code.\nOur insight for this approach is that the specific property of safe sandboxing is heavily intertwined with memory safety. In particular, code written in a memory-safe language cannot escape the confines of the memory provided to it. Informally, this means that by lifting (potentially unsafe) code to a memory-safe language, and then compiling that lifted code to machine code, the generated machine code must be safely sandboxed, due to the memory safety of the intermediate memory-safe language.\nWhile other memory-safe languages would also suffice to obtain safe sandboxing, we pick Rust as our memory-safe language of choice for rWasm, since it is a non-garbage-collected systems-oriented language, which allows us to obtain predictable performance. While Rust does have a non-memory-safe escape hatch via the unsafe keyword (since certain scenarios, such as writing an operating system, might need more control than directly allowed by the language), as long as this keyword is not used (ensured by the declaration #![forbid(unsafe)]), Rust guarantees memory safety. Given the prevalence of Rust in industry, and how seriously the Rust team takes unsoundness bugs, safe Rust is thus battle-tested to be memory safe, even if not (yet) proven to be so. Early efforts towards formalization of Rust and its security guarantees have already begun, such as with the RustBelt and Oxide projects.\nWe implement all stages of rWasm in safe Rust, but note that none of it needs to be trusted or verified. This means we do not need to depend upon the safety or correctness of any part of rWasm for the safety of the produced executable machine code. Instead, the safety of the produced code simply comes from the lack of any unsafe in the generated Rust code (and that unsafe-free Rust guarantees memory safety, as mentioned before). Contrast this with say, wasm2c, which requires either trusting (in addition to the C compiler itself) the wasm2c compiler, or its generated C code, since C does not guarantee memory safety.\nAstute readers will note that sandbox safety in any type-safe language also depends on the language’s runtime libraries. Fortunately, rWasm imports nothing, uses only allocation-related features (for Vec), and even eliminates dependency on the Rust standard library via the #![no_std] directive. As with any sandbox, care is required when exposing an API to sandboxed code (e.g., to avoid APIs enabling sandbox bypasses directly or via confused deputies), but such concerns are orthogonal to sandbox construction.\nEvaluation\nHow do vWasm and rWasm perform in practice? We measure both techniques on a collection of quantitative and qualitative metrics, and while more details can be found in our full paper, we show some selected results here.\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean execution time of PolyBench-C benchmarks across the Wasm runtimes, normalized to pure native execution. Interpreters have square brackets; just-in-time (JIT) compilers have braces; the rest are ahead-of-time (AOT) compilers. vWasm* disables sandboxing.\n\nRun-time performance is critical for practical adoption in most applications. Hence, we benchmark our compilers and various baselines using the PolyBench-C benchmark suite, which consists of thirty programs and has been a standard benchmark suite for Wasm since its inception. Figure 2 summarizes our results, showing the normalized execution time of the benchmarks on the Wasm runtimes.  Each point in the chart is the ratio of the mean time taken to execute the benchmark with the particular runtime vs. the mean time taken to execute by compiling the C code directly to non-sandboxed x64, skipping Wasm entirely.\nThe results indicate that, unsurprisingly, compiled code strictly outperforms interpreted code for run-time performance. With respect to our compilers, we see that vWasm consistently outperforms the interpreters on all benchmarks, and that rWasm is competitive even with the compilers which are optimized for speed, and not necessarily safety. We note that the relative performance amongst the compilers can vary drastically based upon the workload (for example, on some of the longer-running programs in the benchmark suite, rWasm is more than twice as fast as WAVM [8], which itself is twice as fast as rWasm on other benchmarks). Looking at vWasm and vWasm* (which is vWasm but with the sandboxing pass disabled), we find that the run time is marginally affected (by only 0.2%), indicating that almost all of the slowdown for vWasm, compared to other compilers, is due to the unverified portion of the compiler, which can be improved without needing to write any new proofs or even impacting existing proofs.\nNext, we quantify the development effort needed to implement both vWasm and rWasm. The former took approximately two person-years to develop, including both code and proofs, while the latter took one person-month. This stark contrast is a testament to the daunting amount of work formal verification requires, even with modern, automated tools like F*. It also illustrates the significant benefit of rWasm’s carefully leveraging Rust’s investment in safety.\nFinally, provable safety is an important property of a verified sandboxing compiler, but one might wish to prove other properties, such as traditional compiler correctness. Here, vWasm has the upper hand, as this is feasible to do in F*, and we have even structured the compiler to make such proofs possible. In contrast, proving correctness for rWasm would be a challenging task, since one would need to formally model the Rust language, show that rWasm preserves Wasm semantics in compiling to Rust, and then implement a semantics-preserving Rust compiler (or prove rustc as semantics-preserving). The nature of the provable sandboxing property is what puts it into the sweet spot where we obtain it “for free” when compiling to Rust, and we believe there may be other such properties where one can obtain provable guarantees in a similar fashion. However, all these properties are a strict subset of what might be proven for an implementation like vWasm, which is built in a full-blown verification-oriented language.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we have explored two concrete points in the design space for implementing a sandboxing execution environment, with a focus on WebAssembly. We proposed designs for these two points, implemented them as open-source tools, vWasm and rWasm, and evaluated them on a collection of both quantitative and qualitative metrics. We show that run-time performance and provable safety are not in conflict, and indeed rWasm is the first Wasm runtime that is both provably-sandboxed and fast.\nWe refer the interested reader to our paper [1] and to our open-source tools vWasm [2] and rWasm [3].\n\nA version of this blogpost was previously posted as an article in USENIX ;login:.\n\n\n\n[1] Provably-Safe Multilingual Software Sandboxing using WebAssembly.

(Quick disclaimer: There is\nno quantum computing in here, despite the name.) To do explain the new\nbookkeeping devices of the quantum physicist’s method,\nthis post will first explain the classical physicist’s method\nfor algorithm analysis, then describe the difficulties it encounters when\nadapted to the domain of program analysis, and finally lay out the\nsolution granted by bookkeeping with the quantum physicist’s method.\nThe Classical Physicist’s Method\nTo make sense of the physicist’s method (and the later refinements we’ll make to it), it is\ngood to start by recalling the physical reasoning behind it. Think back to your highschool physics class\nwhere you learned about energy. If you drop a 1 kilogram ball from\n1 meter above the Earth, and drop an identical ball from the top of a 1 meter high ramp, how do their speeds compare\nwhen they hit the ground?\nIt might seem like I haven’t given you enough information, but a neat little physical\nprinciple called conservation of energy tells you all you need to know. At the start, both balls\nhave the same amount1 of (gravitational) potential energy since they are the same height, same mass, and subject to the same\ngravity. And at the end, both balls have none, since their distance from the ground is 0. Because the\ntotal energy is conserved, we know that all that energy must still be around, just in some other form - in this case,\nas kinetic energy in the balls’ speeds. So even though both\nballs took different routes to the ground, the same energy goes into their speed, and thus the speeds are the same2.\nLet me emphasize that point: As long as we know energy is conserved,\nwe can measure expenditure with the difference between starting and ending energy.\nEventually Robert Tarjan and Danny Sleator brought this idea to computer science.\nThey introduced it to define\namortized algorithm costs (see here).\nHowever, the idea of amortization itself is much older, and comes from the financial industry.\nAmortization is used to express a notion of average cost where occasional\nspikes of high cost are prepaid over longer periods of time, like paying off a loan\nin installments instead of all at once at the due date. However, if we think about this\nprepayment as storing extra potential energy for later, the reasoning becomes exactly the\nsame as reasoning about conservation of energy. Hence, Tarjan and Sleator suggested\ncalling the approach “the physicist’s method”3.\nTo see how this all comes up in the analysis of algorithms, consider implementing an arbitrarily sized list using\nfixed-size arrays4. In particular, lets look at the list’s insertion function, and measure its\ncost in how many array write accesses it uses. The common case is that list insertion will just be able to directly write a new\nelement into the next unused slot in the array, for a cost of 1 write. But eventually, the array will be full with no unusued slots.\nWhen this happens, our implementation will:\n\nallocate a new array double the size of the old one\nwrite all the elements from the old array into the new one\nwrite the new element into the next empty space of the new array\n\nIf you count them, you’ll find this uncommon case uses a number of array writes equal to the length of the list plus one,\nwhich is a far cry from the common case’s constant cost. Worst-case cost analysis thus makes this algorithm look much more\ninefficient than it usually is.\nIf instead we think through a lens of amortization, we find that insertion is, morally-speaking, a constant cost operation.\nEssentially, insertion is cheap enough often enough that prepaying a little extra at each common case\ncan offset the high cost of the uncommon case. We can see how that looks in the graph below5, where the\nblack spikes of cost\nnever exceed the red constant-per-step payment.\n\nTo show this formally, we define a suitable potential function \\(\\Phi\\) giving the amount of prepaid potential energy stored in the\nprogram state. Specifically, our desired \\(\\Phi(A)\\) will be equal to twice the number of\nfilled slots past\nthe halfway point in the array \\(A\\).\nWe can think of this like attaching a 2-charge battery to each individual array cell past the halfway point, so that\nwe deal with that battery’s energy if and only if we access that array cell.\nThe amortized cost of an operation \\(o\\) is then defined as \\(\\Phi(o(A)) - \\Phi(A) + C(A,o)\\), which is the difference in potential induced by \\(o\\) plus \\(C(A,o)\\) its true cost on the array \\(A\\).\nIf we account for this potential energy alongside our normal costs, suddenly the cost profile becomes much smoother:\n\n\nIn the common case, insertion just writes into the next unused slot of \\(A\\). We still pay the true cost of\n\\(C(A,\\mathsf{insert}) = 1\\) for the that write, but now might also need to pay 2 more to “charge the battery”\nif the element is past the halfway point in the array. This “battery-charging” is how we pay for the difference in\npotential as given by \\(\\Phi\\). In the worst case, the total amortized cost is therefore 3.\n\n\nIn the uncommon case, our array \\(A\\) is now full. Thus, we have stored 2 units of potential with half the elements of \\(A\\),\nwhich works out to one unit of potential for each element. So, potential can pay for each element’s write into the new array,\nwith none leftover. The new array itself then has no potential, because it is exactly half full. At this point, stored\npotential has exactly covered the cost of all writes and all the state’s potential, accruing a running cost of 0. Finally\nlist insertion behaves like its common case again, giving worst-case amortized cost of 3.\n\n\nThus, through mediating energy expenditure with potential, we find that\ninsertion into these array-backed lists takes an amortized constant number of writes. The magic\nhappened when we prepaid for two extra writes in the common case to “charge the battery”.\nEventually, that prepayment gets spent in the uncommon case to cover the writes into the\nnew array.\nNow that you’ve seen an example, we can look at the general case:\n\nGiven:\n\na set of operations \\(\\mathsf{op} = \\mathsf{state} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{state} \\)\na true cost function \\(C : \\mathsf{state} \\times \\mathsf{op} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\)\n\nIf you can find:\n\na potential function \\(\\Phi : \\mathsf{state} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\)\namortized cost \\(a_o\\) for each operation \\(o\\)\n\nsuch that \\(\\Phi(S) + a_{o_i} \\geq \\Phi(o_i(S))  + C(S, o_i)\\)\nfor any state \\(S\\),\nThen for any sequence of \\(n\\) operations \\((o_i)\\) and the sequence of states \\((S_i)\\) that they induce :\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{i&lt;n} a_{o_i} + \\Phi(S_{0})  - \\Phi(S_{n}) \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{i&lt;n} C(S_i, o_i)\\]\ni.e., the total amortized cost plus change in potential covers the total true cost.\n\n\nThe condition placed on \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(a_{o_i}\\) is what corresponds to conservation of energy6.\nThe potential in the state \\(\\Phi(S)\\), and the extra energy paid \\(a_{o_i}\\) are sufficient to\ncover the potential stored in the resulting state \\(\\Phi(o_i(S))\\) and the energy\nexpenditure \\(C(S, o_i)\\) – no new energy is created. With that condition in place, just like in physics,\nwe can forget about intermediate states and just focus on the initial and ending states \\(S_0\\) and \\(S_{n}\\).\nHence the conclusion of the theorem, that the potential difference between \\(\\Phi(S_{0})\\) and \\(\\Phi(S_{n})\\)\nplus all the total supplied extra energy can pay for the total energy expenditure.\nIn the above formalization, you might notice that the form of the potential function \\(\\Phi\\) is left abstract.\nThe function could be any sort of complicated, non-uniform, ugly function. But it is no coincidence that\nthe \\(\\Phi\\) we chose in our above example was “nice”. Specifically, this “niceness” amounts to potential being\nlocal – one can think of the state \\(S\\) as broken up into many pieces (our array cells),\neach with their own local amount of potential (our “batteries”).\nThen \\(\\Phi\\) just gives the sum of potential stored on these different pieces,\nand adjusts the potential on a piece only when that piece is directly operated on.\nIn fact, this appears to be exactly how Tarjan intended the\nbookkeeping for the physicist’s method to be conceptualized:\n\nIn order to keep track of saved or borrowed credits [potential], it is generally convenient to\nstore them in the data structure. Regions of the structure containing credits are\nunusually hard to access or update (the credits saved are there to pay for extra work);\nregions containing “debits” are unusually easy to access or update. It is important to\nrealize that this is only an accounting device; the programs that actually manipulate\nthe data structure contain no mention of credits or debits.\n\n– Tarjan in Amortized Computational Complexity\nThis local-view of potential has been time-tested, and is basically the only form of potential\nyou will find in the literature. As such, our goal throughout the rest of this\npost will be to keep our definition of potential as local as possible.\nBuilding a Program Analysis\nTo build a program analysis based on the physicist’s method, we first need to\nadapt the framework above. This is because some of the assumptions made\nabove are simply not applicable in our programmatic setting. The differences\nare mostly technical, but accounting for them does lead to a slightly\ndifferent-looking theorem.\n\n\nThe above framework assumes that operations can be executed in any order.\nThis makes sense when treating the collection of operations like an\ninterface – you don’t know what order an external user might call operations, so\nyour analysis needs to be prepared for anything. However this assumption\nis wrong for analyzing a program (like the implementation of such an interface).\nThe program itself dictates specific sequences of operations, and the\nanalysis must take this into account to get sensible results7.\n\n\nThe above framework assumes that extra energy \\(a_o\\) is\npaid out on a per-operation basis.\nAgain, this makes sense when reasoning about an interface, since an external\nuser pays for each operation they call. However, when a program executes an operation,\nthere is no external user to introduce extra energy into the system, so costs\nmust be paid solely out of the energy supply internal to the program, i.e., the potential\nof the state8.\n\n\nAfter adapting the theorem from the previous section to account for these\ndifferences we are left with something\nlike the statement below. The main changes are that we consider only certain\nsequences of operations, and that we drop amortized costs.\n\nGiven:\n\na set of operations \\(\\mathsf{op} = \\mathsf{state} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{state} \\)\na collection of possible sequences of such operations \\(\\mathsf{seq}\\)\na true cost function \\(C : \\mathsf{state} \\times \\mathsf{op} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\)\n\nIf you can find:\n\na potential function \\(\\Phi : \\mathsf{state} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\)\n\nsuch that \\(\\Phi(S_i) \\geq \\Phi(S_{i+1}) + C(S_i, o_i)\\)\nacross all state sequences induced by \\(\\mathsf{seq}\\)\nfrom any initial state \\(S_0\\)\nThen for any sequence of \\(n\\) operations \\((o_i)\\) prefixing \\(\\mathsf{seq}\\)\nand the sequence of states \\((S_i)\\) that they induce:\n\\[\\Phi(S_{0}) - \\Phi(S_{n}) \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{i&lt;n} C(S_i, o_i)\\]\ni.e., difference in energy bounds the total cost at every point9\n\n\nWith this framework, our program analysis just needs to find a suitable \\(\\Phi\\).\nWe are currently only considering a local definition of \\(\\Phi\\), so our\ntask is really just finding way of\nlocally assigning potential\nto the parts of each individual data structure at each point in our program.\nThere might be many ways to find such a local \\(\\Phi\\),\nbut one simple option is to type the data structures. These\ntypes can then include some annotation indicating how much potential the data structure\nstores where, like “list but with 2 unit of potential per element”. This tells\nyou exactly how much potential each piece holds, making it easy to recover a\nlocally-definable \\(\\Phi\\).\nIf you run\nwith this idea, you might eventually get something that looks similar to\nthe type system called Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA).\nAARA can infer a valid \\(\\Phi\\) through the inference of\npotential-carrying types, and is fully automatable (as its name suggests).\nSee here for AARA’s origin\nand here for an up-to-date implementation.\nThere are also a lot of different ways to approach this problem\napart from AARA. Some approaches are more manual\n(like this\nverification framework using separation logic). Some use potential with\nother traditional techniques (like this\nadaptation of recurrence solving). And some are designed for different\nprogramming environments (like this\none for client-server interactions). I’m certain there are many more options still,\nbut the reason I bring up AARA in particular is that,\nwhile all of these approaches could potentially employ the quantum phyisicist’s method in\nthe future, AARA is the only one that has (and I’m the one that did it).\nTrouble in Paradise\nThis localized-potential approach happens to work rather well in many cases. For instance, AARA\ncan analyze sorting functions and many list manipulations without issue. Nonetheless, it is not hard to confound this approach.\nConsider a simple loading function that populates one of our array-backed list from one of two other lists.\nWhen called, the load function first executes some code (e.g. shouldComeFromList1) to decide which list the data should\ncome from, and then inserts it all one element at a time. Here we see what this might look like in pseudo-code10.\n\nIf we assume that shouldComeFromList1 has no array writes, then we only need consider the cost\nof insertion. Clearly, only one list’s-worth of insertions occurs, and each insertion has an amortized cost of 3,\nso \\(\\Phi\\) need only assign 3 energy-per-element to the list selected by shouldComeFromList1.\nHowever, there is in general no way to statically know which list that is – it is undecidable,\neven if we had access to the source code for shouldComeFromList1.\nThis confounds our local method of accounting, since it must store potential in a specific list,\nbut cannot say which list will end up sourcing the data. We might get around this by having \\(\\Phi\\) yield something\nlike \\(3*\\mathsf{max}(|\\verb“list1“|, |\\verb“list2“|)\\) to cover the worst case, but this \\(\\mathsf{max}\\) is not\nexpressible in a local way - at best, the local approach can overapproximate\n\\(\\mathsf{max}\\) with a sum, giving potential of \\(3*(|\\verb“list1“| + |\\verb“list2“|)\\), the cost for loading both lists.\nAnd while this bound can only be loose by a constant factor of 2, other examples can loosen the bound to be exponentially worse\n(like binary search here).\nAt this point, you might think the bound looseness\nis just some weakness on the analysis’s end, where\npresumably some localization of the tightest potential exists, but the analysis just can’t figure it out.\nHowever, the situation is actually worse:\nWe can create an example where no tight localization suffices, even while nonlocal reasoning\nmakes a tight solution obvious11.\nThis problem happens especially when measuring the cost of a resource like memory,\nsince memory is returned after use12 and can be reused. When a resource returned, it is as\nif additional payment is provided midway through the computation. This could lessen the amount\nof resources needed upfront, but only if those resources aren’t needed prior to when the extra\nresources are returned. In effect, the cost of resources like memory is measured with\ntheir peak cost, the high water mark of the number of resources in use at one time.\nThese resources are therefore a bit more complicated than resources that only tick down, like\ntime. This makes it easy to create a situation with no tight localization of potential, like that below.\nTo see this problem in action, imagine we have a list of data, and two different\ndata processing procedures process1 and process2. To compare the results of\nthese procedures, we might write the code below.\nHow should we account for the memory cost of the comparison, if each of copy13,\nprocess1, and process2 temporarily\nuse one unit of memory per element in the list?\n\nIt seems obvious from the outset that whatever memory copy uses can be\nreused for process1, and that process1’s memory in turn can be reused for process2,\nsince all act on lists of equal length. So, we should only need to allocate \\(|\\verb“data“|\\)\nmemory units. However, if that is all the memory we have,\naccounting for it locally is impossible.\nTo follow the accounting, let’s step through a call to processBoth. We start with the only\ndata structure being our input data, so it must contain all the potential.\nWe proceed to copy data to ready it for each of the processing functions.\nThis copying procedure temporarily uses all the \\(|\\verb“data“|\\) memory units,\nleaving some amount stored on data and some amount stored on dataCopy when\nthe memory is returned.\nThen process1 is applied to data, requiring all of\nthe \\(|\\verb“data“|\\) memory units. Now, because process1 doesn’t touch\ndataCopy, process1 cannot use any of the potential in dataCopy\n– this means data\nneeds to have recieved all the potential, and none is stored on dataCopy. However,\nthis is followed by applying process2 to dataCopy, which results in mirrored accounting for\npotential: all potential should have been returned to dataCopy, with none stored in data!\nWhile we intuitively know that this could be solved by having process1 return\npotential to dataCopy, there is never a time where process1 and dataCopy\nare local to the same operation.\nThus, no local allocation of \\(|\\verb“data“|\\) potential suffices.\nJust like before, the local\napproach can only manage to overapproximate this example by a factor of 2, and can\nbe exponentially worse in other examples.\nThe Quantum Physicist’s Method\nSo far, our situation is rather unfortunate. We have this beautiful framework\nfrom algorithm analysis, but when we naively adapt it to a program analysis we\nmust sacrifice either the efficacy of the result or the beauty of locality.\nHowever, there is a solution: bookkeeping using the quantum physicist’s method.\nTo keep this section intelligible to non-physicists, this section will focus on\nthe actual execution of the method, while any quantum\nphysical parallels that come up will be kept\ncontained in the footnotes.\nThe idea behind the quantum physicist’s method is to introduce\nthe accounting device of “worldviews”. Each individual worldview\n\\(\\phi_j : \\mathsf{state} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) is\njust a normal local accounting of potential like like our previous \\(\\Phi\\),\nthough with the added caveat that they are\nallowed to locally assign negative amounts of potential under special\nconditions14.\nFormally, the collection of worldviews satisfies the following\nproperties for all state sequences induced by \\(\\mathsf{seq}\\)\nfrom any initial state \\(S_0\\)\n\n\n\\(\\forall j. \\hspace{4pt} \\phi_j(S_i) \\geq \\phi_j(S_{i+1}) + C(S_i, o_i)\\),\ni.e., every worldview pays out the usual costs\n\n\n\\(\\exists j. \\hspace{4pt} \\forall T\\subseteq S_i. \\hspace{4pt} \\phi_j(S_i) \\geq 0 \\),\ni.e., some worldview is classically valid, wherein potential is non-negative\neverywhere15\n\n\nGiven these properties, one can prove the following key theorem:\n\nTheorem: \\(max_j\\phi_j\\) is a suitable definition\nof \\(\\Phi\\) for the classical physicist’s method\n\n\nIndeed, the first property meets the bulk of the requirements for a valid\npotential function, and the second property ensures that the max potential\nis always classically valid.\nYou might at this point wonder what this new way of finding a potential\nfunction buys us. The answer is that this simple way of combining our\nfamiliar local accounts of potential introduces some powerful nonlocal\nflexibility. By allowing different worldviews to tactically “go into debt”,\nthis method can infer tighter cost bounds than naive local reasoning can usually\nsupply.\nTo better understand how the mechanics of these worldviews actually work,\nit might help to walk through a situation without so much technical cruft:\nSuppose that\nAlice and Bob get $5 to share from their parents to spend on candy in a candy store. Alice wants a $3\npack of caramels and Bob wants a $2 chocolate bar. However, Alice’s caramels are in a\nvending machine that only takes $5 bills. If Alice keeps $5 to herself, then Bob can’t buy his candy.\nBut if Bob keeps $2 to himself, then Alice can’t use the vending machine for her candy.\nSo, what do Alice and Bob do?\nThe answer is quite simple: Alice buys her caramels with all the money, gets the change back,\nand then gives it to Bob –\nthey both can then get what they want with no extra money needed.\nI’m sure I have done the same with my brother plenty of times growing up.\nWe can bookkeep this the following way:\nstartAlice buysget changetransferBob buys\nAlice/Bob money split5/00/02/00/20/0\n\nAnd this is exactly what we want, with one small caveat:\nThe “transfer” operation is actually quite nontrivial to work with. Only\nhighly specialized programming languages will even have constructs for mentioning\npotential, and those that do will be burdened (or burden the programmer) with\nfiguring out how such constructs can be soundly used. But, by using worldviews for\nbookkeeping, this whole problem can be bypassed entirely. We provide such an\naccount below:\nstartAlice buysget changeBob Buys\nworldview 1 Alice/Bob money split5/00/02/02/-2\nworldview 2 Alice/Bob money split3/2-2/20/20/0\n\nWith this worldview accounting16, we pay the exact same amount out of the same place at each step.\nThe only difference between the two worldviews is that worldview 1 starts in the allocation of money needed\nfor Alice to buy her candy, and worldview 2 starts in the allocation needed for Bob to buy his. Then,\nwe find that the problematic “transfer” occurs where different worldviews become classically valid –\nwe see that happen at “get change”, since worldview 1 is classically valid at “Alice buys”, and\nworldview 2 is classically valid at “Bob buys”. This pattern will hold in general, allowing transfers\nto be coded completely implicitly into our analysis.\nUsing worldviews like this, we can solve both of the problems from the previous section:\n\n\nTo solve the first – the data loading problem – simply start with 2 worldviews: one where list1 carries all potential,\nand one where list2 does. No matter which list pays, there will then be a classically valid worldview.\n\n\nTo solve the second – the data processing problem – start with 2 worldviews assigning data all the potential. Then upon copying,\nlet the worldviews diverge – one leaves all the potential on data, and one moves it all\nto dataCopy. The former can be the classically valid one while applying process1, and the latter when applying process2.\n\n\nIn either case the max amount of potential across the worldviews is exactly the tight amount of potential\nwe wanted assigned.\nAnd so, with worldviews in hand, we can salvage the niceness of locality by wrapping a bunch of local accountings\ntogether and letting them make each other more flexible. From such an accounting we can\nreconstruct a potential function that satisfies the standard framework for\namortized analysis, just as our new theorem ensures. This\nleaves us with a program analysis built off the physicist’s method that can give many tighter\nbounds than its predecessors.\nWrap Up\nIf you are interested in seeing such an analysis in action,\nI’ll point you again to my work extending AARA here.\nMy paper adds the quantum physicist’s method along with some special infrastructure called remainder contexts, and then\nuses its new capabilities to be able to automatically reason about memory usage and tree depth. The work also\ncomes with an implementation, a description of how it was designed, and tables of experiments run with it on\nthe OCaml standard library Set module. The implementation never gave worse cost bounds than the local approach, and often\ngave much better ones. You can check it out and see for yourself!\n1\nSpecifically, they both have \\(1\\mathsf{kg} * 9.81\\frac{\\mathsf{m}}{\\mathsf{s}^2} * 1 \\mathsf{m} = 9.81 \\mathsf{J}\\) of energy.\n\n2\nSpecifically, solving for\n\\(v\\) in the conversion between energy and speed\n\\(9.81\\mathsf{J} = \\frac 1 2 * 1\\mathsf{kg} * (v \\frac{\\mathsf{m}}{\\mathsf{s}})^2 \\) gives\n\\( 4.43\\frac{\\mathsf{m}}{\\mathsf{s}}\\) as the speed of the balls at ground level.\n\n3\nI personally found this analogy with physical reasoning very useful to my\nunderstanding when I was learning about algorithm analysis in undergrad. I’m sure many students feel the same.\n\n4\nThis list would be the data structure called a dynamic array.\nIt is the ArrayList in Java\nand the vector in C++, and probably underlies a lot of other list implementations too.\n\n5\nTaken from here.\n\n6\nTechnically speaking, it only corresponds to the non-creation of energy, since we are interested\nin an upper-bound on cost. Energy conservation means both non-creation and\nnon-loss of energy. Adapting the amortized analysis framework to non-loss would result in a lower-bound on cost.\n\n7\nTo help with this order-sensitivity, we will also from\nnow on consider the program state to have some notion of where it lies in\nexecution, like a program counter. However, this is just a technical point to\nallow \\(\\Phi\\) the flexibility to leverage operation order, and its exact\nimplementation is not important.\n\n8\nOne might consider that external energy could be introduced at the\nvery start when a user calls on the program to execute. However, we will just\nstreamline this initial\npayment by treating it as part of the energy assigned\nto the initial program state.\n\n9\nAs a corollary, since the amortized cost payments are gone,\nwe also find that the potential of the initial\nstate bounds the peak cost. This is more useful to measure resources like memory.\n\n10\nBy pseudo-code I mean python.\n\n11\nFor those with a physics background, you might consider this our version of a Bell test.\nIn physics, this is a case proving that local realism is incompatible with\nquantum quantum mechanics; in our setting, it is a case proving that\npurely local potential is insufficient for a tight cost analysis.\n\n12\nThis return of energy is modeled in our framework simply by letting \\(C\\) return negative costs.\n\n13\nCopying is only really needed in this code if process1 or process2 might mutate the underlying list. However,\nthe pertinent features of code pattern also come up in side-effect free settings during, e.g., tree traversal.\nSee here.\n\n17\nWell, technically a worldview could choose to overpay for the cost too.\n\n14\nThis sets up our worldviews to begin looking somewhat like\nstates in quantum superposition.\nBoth are collections of simultaneous classical-looking states, just with negative\nvalues allowed where they usually wouldn’t be. In quantum physics, those values are\nprobabilities; in our setting, they are potentials.\n\n15\nWhile only a technical point here, the consequences of\nallowing the accumulation of negative potential in some parts of the\nprogram state does\nprovide another quantum physical parallel. Two famous no-go theorems of\nquantum physics, no-cloning\nand no-deleting, mean\nthat a quantum state cannot simply duplicate or delete one of its pieces. These\nsame principles are relevant to the progam states of the quantum physicist’s method: We cannot\nsimply duplicate potential when copying a datastructure, nor may we simply lose potential\nwhen deleting/ignoring a datastructure. Either case could\nintroduce extra potential, when positive amounts are duplicated or negative amounts\nare lost, which would violate conservation.\n\n16\nWe call this particular way of accounting for how to get around the barrier of the vending machine\n“resource tunneling”, because it is analagous to\nquantum tunneling\naround a potential barrier.

In this blog post, I’ll explain what these ways are.\nVerification, mutable memory, and Rust\nFirst, we’re interested in proving code to be “correct”. What does that mean exactly?\nLet’s get our feet wet in verification with some simple examples and then talk about a challenge that Rust helps us solve.\nIntro to Verus\nThe key idea behind Verus is to check additional properties of programs that Rust doesn’t check on its own.\nFor example, consider the following valid Rust program, operating over an 8-bit integer.\n\nThough it’s a valid program, it (potentially) has a problem: if the argument i is more than 127, then the multiplication will overflow the 8-bit integer.\nIf you run Verus on it (which you can try yourself at the Verus playground),\nVerus reports this error:\n\nTo remedy this, the programmer can declare their intent: namely, that the double function should never be called with any argument greater than 127.\n\nThe requires clause is not a standard Rust feature, but a feature of Verus: in general, Verus source code comprises both Rust code and extra directives for Verus, such as this\nrequires clause, also known as a precondition. In any case, Verus now accepts the program (playground link) because with the new assumption, Verus can determine that this arithmetic operation never overflows.\nFurthermore, any time the developer calls double from elsewhere in the program, Verus will check that the call satisfies the precondition.\nKeep in mind, also, that this is a check done statically, checked for all possible executions of the program, not a runtime check.\nSpecifications and program correctness\nWith Verus, we are actually interested in correctness criteria that go beyond simple arithmetic bounds checks.\nUsually, we are interested in proving that a program’s behavior meets some specification, as in this function that computes the maximum of two integers:\n\nAgain, let’s highlight the Verus-specific parts:\nfirst, we have the ensures clause (also known as a postcondition) serving as the function’s specification, along with the name result on the return type,\nwhich is referenced from said postcondition.\nOnce again, the body of the max function is the Rust code we are verifying.\nThe ensures clause denotes a predicate that should hold true at the end of the call to max.\nThis determines what it means for an implementation of max to be “correct”: it is correct if every execution of its code\nreturns a result that meets its specification.\nSo, how does Verus actually check that this property holds?\nTo do this, Verus (and similar tools) encode the correctness of max as logical formulae called verification conditions:\n\\[ a &gt; b \\implies result = a \\implies (result = a \\lor result = b) \\land (result \\ge a) \\land (result \\ge b) \\]\n\\[ \\lnot(a &gt; b) \\implies result = b \\implies (result = a \\lor result = b) \\land (result \\ge a) \\land (result \\ge b) \\]\nThese conditions are simplified a bit for presentation, but they are close enough for intuition.\nThe first of these would be read as, “if \\( a &lt; b \\) (i.e., the first branch is taken), and if \\( result \\) is set to the return value \\( a \\), then the conditions of\nthe ensures clause hold”. The second condition is similar, but for the else side of the branch.\nIf we prove the verification conditions are correct, this implies the correctness of the program according to its specification.\nTo do so, Verus uses an automated theorem prover—in this case, Z3—to prove the verifification conditions hold for all\nvalues of a, b, and result. This example is simple enough that Z3 can validate the conditions quickly, though for more complicated examples, the developer may need to write additional proofs\nto help it out. If Z3 is unable to prove the theorem, either because it is wrong, or because it needs additional help to prove, then Verus outputs an error message like the one from\nthe previous section.\nSpecification-checking is extremely useful for situations where an implementation is optimized and handles low-level details, but we would like to provide a higher-level, mathematically precise specification.\nFor example:\n\nA program uses the bitwise operation (x &amp; (x - 1)) == 0 to determine if x is a power-of-2, but uses a more mathematically precise specification, \\( \\exists b.~ 2^b = x \\).\nA data-structure implements a hash table or a red-black tree, but has a specification stating that its operations are equivalent to those of a mathematical set.\nA replicated data structure with a sophisticated synchronization algorithm uses a specification that it acts indistinguishably from a single copy of the data structure.\n\nChallenge: handling mutable memory\nOne such “low-level detail” we often have to reason about is mutable heap state.\nTo see why this is challenging without Rust’s help, let us set aside Rust for a moment,\nand imagine we designed a programming language with general pointer types, like in C.\nConsider a simple function that takes two pointers and updates one of them:\n\nThis program looks straightforward at first, but it actually has a problem: what if x and x_not point to the same memory?\nThen *x would be updated when we update *x_not. Therefore, a tool would never be able to prove this code matches its specification—it simply isn’t true.\n\nLeft: what the developer imagines happening. Right: what might actually happen.\nOne solution is to specify that the pointers do not alias with each other, i.e., that they don’t point to the same memory location:\n\nRecall the requires clause here indicates an assumption the function can make at the beginning of its execution.\nBy making this assumption, Verus can now check that the specification holds, although now every call to compute_boolean_not\nwill need to uphold this contract.\nUnfortunately, adding these “non-aliasing conditions” gets unwieldy fast, as data structures increase both in breadth and depth.\nThis was our experience when we wrote the first version of VeriBetrKV, a key-value store developed in Dafny, which has a similar aliasing situation to our C-like language.\nNot only were the conditions difficult to write manually, but getting them wrong often led to error messages that were difficult to diagnose.\nRust to the rescue\nIn Rust, it isn’t common to use general-purpose pointer types. Instead, Rust uses more restricted reference types. In Rust, the types &amp;T and &amp;mut T\neach denote a reference to a value of type T.\nIn the case of &amp;mut T, which is specifically a mutable reference, the user is able\nto modify the value behind the pointer.\nThus, in Rust/Verus, our boolean-negation example would look like this, with the x_not parameter marked as a mutable reference.\n\nAt the machine code level, these references are just like pointers, but the Rust type system enforces additional properties: namely, a &amp;mut reference to a piece of data can never coexist\nwith another reference to that data. Rust enforces this property because it is crucial to Rust’s guarantees about memory safety.\nHowever, this property is also a huge boon for software verification. Because the non-aliasing property is checked by Rust’s type system,\nthe developer no longer has to write the non-aliasing conditions\nmanually. Furthermore, Rust’s type system is fast and often presents high-quality error messages when the property is violated.\nOne can think of this as if these non-aliasing conditions are\ninserted automatically, so the developer doesn’t have to worry about it, but in fact, the situation is even better: the verification tool can simplify the verification conditions to not include any\nnotion of pointer addresses in the first place! In fact, some of my colleagues have published a paper quantifying the gains from this kind of simplification.\nAre reference types all we need?\nThe fact that Rust works as a language at all is evidence that reference types are sufficient\nmost of the time. Unfortunately, most of the time isn’t good enough. The non-aliasing\nreference problem gets in the way for implementing any of the following:\n\nDoubly-linked lists\nReference-counted pointers (e.g., Rust’s Rc, similar to C++’s shared_ptr)\nAny manner of concurrent algorithm: locks, message-passing queues, memory allocators, systems with domain-specific logic for avoiding data races\n\nThe reason these examples give difficulty is because Rust’s type system enforces that any object have a unique “owner” (unless those owners are immutable references).\nHowever, these examples seemingly need to violate the restriction:\n\nIn a doubly-linked list, each node has two neighbors which point to it. Thus, these nodes do not have unique owners.\n\nWhen working with reference-counted smart pointers, each object may have multiple reference objects. These objects need to coordinate via the reference count to drop the given object at the appropriate time. This counter does not have a unique owner.\n\nIn a message passing queue, the producer thread and the consumer thread have to share a queue buffer to store in-flight messages. This buffer does not have a unique owner.\nSo how can we tackle these kinds of problems?\nFor such things, Rust programmers need to use Rust’s notorious “unsafe code” which opts in to various Rust features that\nthe type system is unable to validate are used safely. As such, the burden goes from the\ntype-checker to the programer to ensure they are used correctly.\nApplications like the above are generally considered low-level, and they are often\nrelegated to time-tested libraries. It’s these kinds of low-level systems, though,\nthat we are especially interested in verifying! So what do we do?\nUnsafe code in Verus, or: “condititionally safe code”\nWith Verus, we can recover the ability to implement such things while having a computer-checked guarantee of memory safety.\nA Rust feature being  “unsafe” really just means that the developer has to uphold a certain contract to use it safely, which Rust cannot check.\nIt is for this reason that I like to call unsafe code conditionally safe—i.e., it is safe subject to meeting\ncertain conditions. Rust cannot check these conditions, but Verus can.\nHere is a simple example: Rust’s common vector indexing operation performs a bounds-check to ensure there is no memory corruption from an out-of-bounds access.\nTherefore, this function is unconditionally “safe” to call, no matter what index the caller provides: even if the caller provides something out-of-bounds, the program might panic and exit, but it will never corrupt memory.\nHowever, there is a lesser-used get_unchecked operation which performs no such bounds check.\nThus, get_unchecked is only safe to call if the index is\nalready known to be in-bounds, thus making it unsafe (conditionally safe).\nThis condition can be codified as a Verus requires clause:\n\nNow, Verus will check that the index is in-bounds whenever get_unchecked is called.\nThus, we can regain assurance in code that uses this function, provided that Verus is able to validate the code.\nHandling unsafe ownership\nBounds-checking makes for an easy example, but when we consider programs like the ones\ndiagrammed above, the situation gets a little more complicated.\nRecall that what characterizes these systems is that the objects may be pointed to\nfrom multiple owners, which have to coordinate their access somehow.\nAs a result, the “conditions” of the conditionally safe operations become\nsubstantially more involved. For example, accessing data through a pointer is only safe if there is no\ndata race, i.e., another thread trying to access it at the same time. Such a condition seems inherently “non-local” as it involved talking about all threads at once,\nand therefore is much harder to check than that of a simple index being in bounds.\nHowever, we have already discussed that Rust’s type system allows us to ensure the unique ownership of data, which then rules out illegal operations such as data races.\nTherefore, the kind of “condition” we need to check is already the exact kind of condition that Rust’s type system is designed to ensure.\nThe problem here is just that these particular data structures do not use the specific types that are designed to ensure this. So how can we apply Rust’s philosophy anyway?\nSince the data structures we want to verify use objects that don’t obey Rust’s unique ownership, our trick is to add new objects that do.\nHowever, we don’t want to bog down the program with extra data—that would defeat the point of writing optimized code—so these new objects are merely “conceptual proof objects.”\nIn verification languages, such objects are often called ghost objects, not because they are spooky, but because they have no influence on the “physical world.” The real data structures in the compiled binary\nwould be the ones diagramed above, but Verus treats the program as if the ghost objects were really there when generating its verification conditions.\nFor example, for a program that uses pointers, Verus programs can use a ghost object that represents “the right to read or write memory from the given location.”\nJust like for ordinary (“real”) data, Rust’s type system ensures that ownership this object is unique. Verus in turn ensures that such an object is\npresent when the program accesses the data behind the pointer. Combining both results, we can be confident that such an access really is data-race-free.\nEven while multiple owners might point to the same piece of data, in the sense of physically having a pointer to it, only one owner at a time can have the right to manipulate that data.\nTo verify a doubly-linked list, then, we would arrange nodes with pointers in the usual way, but in addition to the “real” nodes, we would have an additional collection of ghost objects\nthat represent the right to access those nodes. By writing additional Verus annotations, we can explain, mathematically, how these ghost objects relate to the structure of the linked list,\nand as a result we can use the ghost objects to traverse the list.\nFor more details, you can see our paper, where we present the doubly-linked list in detail.\nFurther reading\nThere is currently one paper on Verus available, which introduces Verus and works out\nthe doubly-linked list example in detail, among others.

Verus: Verifying Rust Programs Using Linear Ghost Types.

Verus incorporates a lot of our\nlearnings from Linear Dafny, which there are several papers on.\nWe first introduced Linear Dafny in this paper on VeriBetrKV, a verified key-value store:\nTravis Hance, Andrea Lattuada, Chris Hawblitzel, Jon Howell, Rob Johnson, and Bryan Parno.

(OSDI 2023)\nRelated work\nVerus is far from the only Rust verification tool around.\nRustBelt is a framework for verifying unsafe code within a precise mathematical formalism of a model of the Rust langauge.\nIt is notable because it can prove general memory-safety theorems about Rust’s type system, even in the presence of libraries that use unsafe code.\nHowever, it does not take advantage of Rust’s type system for the sake of verification, and it doesn’t target developers writing actual Rust code.\nOther tools which, like Verus, target developers include Prusti,\nKani,\nAeneas,\nand Creusot.\nOf these, the one most similar to Verus is likely Creusot, which takes advantage of the Rust type system in a similar way to generate simple verification conditions.\nCreusot is also notable for its “prophecy encoding” of mutable references, which is more general than Verus’ current mutable reference support.\nWhat distinguishes Verus, by contrast, is its support for these ghost objects and especially their use in concurrency.\nConclusion\nRust’s type system, and similar type systems that enforce unique ownership over data,\nare enormously helpful in designing a verification language for low-level code.\nJust as Rust guarantees memory safety, thus taking the burden off the developer in the common case,\nVerus takes advantage of the same to remove the burden of complex aliasing conditions for verification developers.\nMore surprisingly, though, we can apply Rust’s type system even for code that initially seems very un-Rust-like, which is common in highly-optimized systems code.\nSpecifically,\nby utilizing ghost objects\nwe recover the ability to use Rust’s ownership system\n(together with Verus to check conditionally safe code)\nto check code where the type system would not help in ordinary Rust.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/rust-verification-with-verus/","title":"Verus: A tool for verified systems code in Rust"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/withheld/":{"body":"This blog post is based on a research paper with the same title, authored by Anilesh Krishnaswamy, Haoming Li, David Rein, Hanrui Zhang, and Vincent Conitzer, published at AAAI 2021.\nTL;DR: We investigate a classification problem where each data point being classified is controlled by an agent who has its own goals or incentives, and may strategically withhold certain features in order to game the classifer and get a more desirable label.  We use (an oversimplied version of) college admissions as a running example to illustrate how traditional methods may fail in such settings, as well as how insights from the economic field of mechanism design may help.  We then demonstrate a principled method — Incentive-Compatible Logistic Regression — for classification problems with strategically withheld features, which achieves remarkable empirical performance on credit approval data.\nApplicants to most colleges in the US are required to submit their scores for at least one of the SAT and the ACT.\nApplicants usually take one of these two tests — whichever works to their advantage.\nHowever, given the growing competitiveness of college admissions, many applicants now take both tests and then strategically decide whether to drop one of the scores (if they think it will hurt their application) or report both.\nThe key issue here is that it is impossible to distinguish between an applicant who takes both tests but reports only one, and an applicant who takes only one test — for example, because the applicant simply took the one required by their school, the dates for the other test did not work with their schedule, or for other reasons that are not strategic in nature.\nSuch ambiguity makes it harder for colleges to accurately evaluate applicants, especially since colleges now increasingly rely on machine learning techniques to help make admissions decisions.\nWhat Can Go Wrong?\nConsider the following simplified scenario: each applicant may naturally (i.e., before they strategically drop one of the scores) have an SAT score, an ACT score, or both.\nWe also assume these scores are normalized, so they become real numbers between 0 and 1.\nSuppose the true competitiveness of an applicant is the average of the scores they naturally have — that is, if an applicant naturally has only one score, then that score is their true competitiveness; if an applicant naturally has both scores, then their true competitiveness is the average of the two scores.\nWe will use this setup as our running example from now on.\nWe will not try to “solve” this example problem (later we will see that in some cases, there is no satisfactory solution to the problem), but rather, we will use the example to illustrate the limitations of some classical methods, as well as to motivate the more principled method that we propose.\nNow a college wishes to assess each applicant’s competitiveness based on the scores, and admit all applicants whose competitiveness is at least 0.5 (or some threshold chosen by the college).\nAssuming all applicants report all scores they naturally have, it is easy to make admissions decisions: the college simply computes each applicant’s average score, and admits that applicant if the average is at least 0.5.\nIn other words, the college implements a simple classifier, which assigns any applicant label “admitted” if the average value of their natural features is at least 0.5.\nHowever, the simple classifier has its problems: after it is used for admissions for a couple of years, applicants may eventually figure out how it works (for example, by talking to past applicants and researching their test scores and application results).\nOnce applicants know how the decisions are made, they can easily game the system by strategically withholding information.\nConsider, for example, an applicant with an SAT score of 0.6 and an ACT score of 0.2.\nThe applicant would normally be rejected since their true competitiveness is 0.4, which is smaller than the classifier’s threshold, 0.5.\nHowever, knowing how the classifier works, the applicant can withhold the ACT score and report the SAT score only to the college.\nThen the classifier would mistakenly believe that the applicant’s competitiveness is 0.6, and admit the applicant.\nAs a result, the classifier is not accurate anymore when applicants act strategically and try to game it.\n(How) Can We Fix It?\nTaking into consideration the fact that applicants will eventually figure out how decisions are made, and in response to that, withhold scores strategically to maximize their chances, is it still possible for the college to admit exactly those applicants that the college wants to admit?\nThe answer is — perhaps not so surprisingly — it depends on the distribution of applicants, including how often each score is missing, as well as how the two scores correlate.\nTo illustrate this dependence, below we discuss two extreme cases.\n\nIn one extreme case (illustrated in the left of the figure), every applicant naturally has both scores and the college knows that.\nThen, the college’s problem is again simple: the college admits an applicant if and only if that applicant reports both scores, and the average of the two scores is at least 0.5.\nThis ensures that no applicant would want to withhold a score, because that would lead to automatic rejection.\nMoreover, no applicant would be mistakenly rejected because they cannot report both scores, since everyone naturally has both scores.\nIn another extreme case (illustrated in the right of the figure), there are only two types of applicants: a type-1 applicant naturally has an SAT score of 0.6 and does not have an ACT score; a type-2 applicant naturally has an SAT score of 0.6 and an ACT score of 0.2.\nIdeally, the college would like to admit all type-1 applicants (because their competitiveness is 0.6), and reject all type-2 applicants (because their competitiveness is 0.4).\nHowever, this is impossible once applicants respond strategically to the college’s classifier.\nFor example, if the college admits all type-1 applicants whose SAT score is 0.6 and ACT score is missing, then a type-2 applicant would pretend to be a type-1 applicant by withholding their ACT score, and get admitted too.\nOn the other hand, to prevent type-2 applicants getting in by pretending to be type-1 applicants, the college would have to reject all type-1 applicants too, eventually admitting no one.\nA Principled Approach via Mechanism Design\nThe above discussion highlights one fact: when applicants respond strategically, the optimal classifier must depend on the distribution of applicants, even if the college’s criteria for admissions stays the same, and there is no restrictions whatsoever on how many applicants can be admitted.\nThis is reminiscent of problems in mechanism design.\nIn a mechanism design problem, a principal designs and commits to a decision rule, or a mechanism — in the admissions problem discussed above, the principal is the college, and the decision rule is the classifier used for admissions.\nSelf-interested agents (e.g., applicants) then respond to this rule by reporting (possibly nontruthfully) their private information (e.g., their test scores) to the principal.\nThe mechanism then chooses an outcome (e.g., admissions decisions) based on the reported information.\nTaking the agents’ strategic behavior into consideration, the principal aims to design a mechanism to maximize their own utility (e.g., accuracy of admissions decisions), which generally depends on both the outcome and the agents’ private information.\nIn fact, in our running example, the college’s problem can be cast directly as a mechanism design problem.\nBelow we will see how tools from mechanism design can help in solving the college’s classification problem.\nIncentive Compatibility and the Revelation Principle\nA key notion in mechanism design is incentive compatibility: a mechanism is incentive-compatible if it is always in the agents’ best interest to truthfully report their private information.\nApplied to our running example, incentive compatibility means that applicants would never want to withhold a test score that they naturally have.\nOne reason that incentive compatibility is so important in mechanism design is that it is often without loss of generality: if there is no restriction on the ways in which an agent can (mis)report their private information, then for any (possibly not incentive-compatible) mechanism, there always exists an “incentive-compatible version” of that mechanism which achieves the same effects.\nThis is famously known as the revelation principle.\nThe reason that the revelation principle holds is simple: the principal can adapt any mechanism into an incentive-compatible one by “misreporting for” the agents, in the exact way that the agents would misreport in response to the original mechanism.\nWe show that a variant of the revelation principle applies to the college’s classification problem (and more generally, to all classification problems with strategically withheld features).\nThis greatly simplifies the problem, because without loss of generality, we only need to consider classifiers under which applicants have no incentive to withhold any score.\nThis effectively removes the strategic aspect and leaves a clean classification problem.\nIncentive-Compatible Logistic Regression\nGiven the revelation principle, we propose a principled method, incentive-compatible logistic regression, for classification problems with strategically withheld data.\nThe idea is simple: we run the classical gradient-based algorithm for logistic regression, but with the search space restricted to classifiers that are incentive-compatible.\nThe college can then use the resulting model to classify applicants in an incentive-compatible way.\nWe will see below how this can be done by adding a projection step to the region of incentive-compatible classifiers, after each gradient step.\nRecall that in logistic regression, the goal is to learn a set of coefficients \\({\\beta_i}\\), one for each feature \\(i\\), as well as an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\), such that for each data point \\((x, y)\\), the predicted label \\(\\hat{y}\\) given by\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\mathbb{I}\\left[\\sigma\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_i x_i \\cdot \\beta_i\\right) \\ge 0.5\\right]\n\\]\nfits the true label \\(y\\) as well as possible.\nHere, \\(\\sigma\\) is the logistic function, defined as\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = 1 / (1 + e^{-t}).\n\\]\nMapping these notions back to our running example, each data point \\((x, y)\\) corresponds to an applicant, where each feature \\(x_i\\) is one of the two scores, and the true label \\(y\\) is \\(1\\) (corresponding to “admitted”) if the applicant’s true competitiveness is at least the college’s desired threshold, and \\(0\\) (corresponding to “rejected”) otherwise.\nThe classifier computes a predicted label \\(\\hat{y}\\) for each data point, which is the admissions decision for that specific applicant.\nNaturally, the college wants \\(\\hat{y}\\) to fit \\(y\\) as well as possible.\nIt turns out there is a simple condition for the classifier of the above form to be incentive-compatible.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose each feature \\(x_i\\) is always nonnegative.\nthis is naturally true in our running example, since each feature is a score between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\); in general, we can shift the features if they are not nonnegative.\nMoreover, if a feature is missing in a data point, then we simply treat that feature as \\(0\\).\nThen a classifier induced by \\({\\beta_i}\\) is incentive-compatible if and only if each \\(\\beta_i\\) is nonnegative.\nThis is because if some \\(\\beta_i &lt; 0\\), then a data point with feature \\(x_i &gt; 0\\) will be able to increase their score, \\(\\sigma\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_i x_i \\cdot \\beta_i\\right)\\), by withholding feature \\(x_i\\).\nDepending on the values of other features, this will sometimes change the predicted label of that data point from \\(0\\) (i.e., rejected) to \\(1\\) (i.e., admitted).\nIn other words, such a classifier cannot be incentive-compatible.\nOn the other hand, if each \\(\\beta_i\\) is nonnegative, then for any data point, withholding a feature \\(x_i\\) can never increase the score, so there is no incentive to withhold any feature.\nGiven the above characterization, we can simply adapt the gradient-based algorithm for (unconstrained) logistic regression to find a good incentive-compatible classifier.\nWe initialize the classifier arbitrarily, and repeat the following steps for each data point \\((x, y)\\) until convergence:\n\n\nThe gradient step: Let\n\\[\n\\beta_0 \\gets \\beta_0 - \\eta_t \\cdot \\left(\\sigma\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_i x_i \\cdot \\beta_i\\right) - y\\right).\n\\]\nFor each feature \\(i\\), let\n\\[\n\\beta_i \\gets \\beta_i - \\eta_t \\cdot \\left(\\sigma\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_i x_i \\cdot \\beta_i\\right) - y\\right) \\cdot x_i.\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\eta_t\\) is the learning rate in step \\(t\\).\nThis rate normally decreases in \\(t\\), e.g., \\(\\eta_t = 1 / \\sqrt{t}\\).\n\n\nThe projection step: For each feature \\(i\\), let\n\\[\n\\beta_i \\gets \\max\\{0, \\beta_i\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nThis can be viewed as an instantiation of the projected gradient descent algorithm: the gradient step is exactly the same as in (unconstrained) logistic regression, and the projection step ensures that the incentive-compatibility constraint is satisfied.\nComing back to our running example, incentive-compatible logistic regression will assign a nonnegative weight to each test score and admit an applicant if the weighted sum of the two scores exceeds some threshold.  Note that this does not “solve” the college’s problem in all cases: for example, between the two extreme cases discussed above, incentive-compatible logistic regression would work very well in the first case, but in the second case its performance would not be practically meaningful, simply because the second case is intrinsically hard and no classifier can achieve a reasonable accuracy there.\nExperimental Results\nWe empirically evaluate incentive-compatible logistic regression on 4 real-world credit approval datasets from the UCI ML Repository, based on historical data collected in Australia, Germany, Poland, and Taiwan.\nEach data point in each dataset corresponds to a single credit application, with tens of features (3 datasets provide 15-23 features, and the other provides 64), including annual income, employment status, current balance in savings account, etc.\nEach data point has a binary label, which is either “approve” (i.e., 1) or “reject” (i.e., 0).\nWe preprocess the datasets by randomly dropping some features for each data point, thus simulating naturally missing features.\nWe consider two ways of reporting in our evaluation:\n\n\nTruthful reporting: Each data point always reveals all features it naturally has to the classifier.\nThis is the assumption made by the baseline methods, which we compare against in our evaluation.\n\n\nStrategic reporting: In reponse to the classifier, each data point optimally withholds a subset of features to maximize the chance of getting approved (i.e., label 1).\nFor incentive-compatible logistic regression, strategic reporting is equivalent to truthful reporting.\nHowever, as we will see, the baseline methods perform significantly worse with strategic reporting (which is natural, since they were not designed to be robust against strategic manipulation).\n\n\nAs for the baseline methods, we compare against logistic regression (without incentive-compatibility), neural networks, and random forests.\nThese are the most popular and accurate methods in credit approval applications.\nFor more details of the experiments, please see Section 6 of our paper.\nThe accuracy of each classifier tested on each dataset can be found in the table below.\nNote that there are two numbers in each cell: the left one corresponds to the accuracy under truthful reporting, and the right one corresponds to the accuracy under strategic reporting.\nClassifierAustraliaGermanyPolandTaiwan\nIncentive-compatible logistic regression0.800 / 0.8000.651 / 0.6510.698 / 0.6980.646 / 0.646\nLogistic regression (baseline)0.800 / 0.7630.652 / 0.5800.714 / 0.6600.670 / 0.618\nArtificial neural networks (baseline)0.800 / 0.7470.652 / 0.5800.719 / 0.6360.688 / 0.543\nRandom forest (baseline)0.797 / 0.5410.633 / 0.5160.709 / 0.5220.684 / 0.588\n\nHere we make two observations:\n\nUnder strategic reporting, incentive-compatible logistic regression is consistently much more accurate than all 3 baseline methods.\nThis highlights the importance of robustness against strategic manipulation by design.\nThe accuracy of incentive-compatible logistic regression under strategic reporting is often comparable to that of the baseline methods under truthful reporting.\nIn other words, although strategic manipulation poses challenges in the design of a good classifier, from an information-theoretic perspective, the classification problem does not become much harder.\n\nConclusion\nWe study the problem of classification when each data point can strategically withhold some of its features to obtain a more favorable outcome.\nWe propose a principled classification method, incentive-compatible logistic regreggsion, which is robust to strategic manipulation.\nThe new method is tested on real-world datasets, showing that it outperforms out-of-the-box methods that do not account for strategic behavior.\nMore generally, we draw connections between strategic classification and mechanism design, which may inspire future work in other strategic classification settings.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2023/withheld/","title":"Classification with Strategically Withheld Data"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/","title":""},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/anonymous-blocklisting/":{"body":"TL;DR:\n\nTruly Anonymous Service Providers can offer users confirmed privacy, but also allow inappropriate behavior 😳\nAnonymous Blocklisting permits blocking ill-behaved users without denanonymizing them.

In the conclusion, I will reflect on open problems for future anonymous blocklisting algorithms.\nAnonymous Communications Systems\nAnonymous communications systems bring benefits but also harms. Computing users’ private information has always been vulnerable to irresponsible corporations and identity theft. On top of that, oppressed citizens living under authoritarian governments struggle to maintain their privacy and risk facing prosecution for speaking out, while political journalists have to fight to keep their sources hidden. Anonymous communications systems aim to help these users by keeping their identities private from other observers.\nThe largest network that allows anonymous communication to date is Tor, which utilizes “onion routing”, encrypting the data multiple times and passing it through a network of different nodes, making it difficult to trace back to the source. Unfortunately, malicious users can take advantage of the gift of anonymity resulting in online bullying and harassment, trolling, and the spread of harmful or illegal content without consequences. The problem is the following:\nIf no one knows who you are, no one can stop you.\n\nHow can internet services provide anonymity to users without allowing inappropriate behavior?\nMany service providers claim to be anonymous but have often been criticized for storing the user’s information, or metadata that can help identify them. For instance, Wikipedia provides weak anonymity by connecting a user’s personal information to a pseudonym instead of directly storing it. Thus, all of their actions (e.g., page edits) are publicly linked to their profile, and analyzing patterns in editing behavior or content preferences could lead to inferences about their identity.\nOne existing solution to linked metadata is using “revocable anonymity systems”, which allow for a user to be deanonymized or pseudoanonymized (having their actions linked) when necessary. For example, imagine if Wikipedia users were completely anonymous (i.e., without a public pseudonym), but if one of your edits is deemed “inappropriate”, your anonymity is stripped and your identity is revealed. This type of system typically relies on a Trusted Third Party aware of the identity of the user and capable of revoking a user’s privacy at their discretion.\nAnonymous Blocklisting\nAnonymous blocklisting systems come to the rescue to enforce policies on users without deanonymizing them. These systems allow users to authenticate anonymously with a service provider, while service providers can revoke a user’s access without learning any information about their identity or involving a Trusted Third Party. Anonymous blocklisting systems can achieve blocking users from posting again by flagging individual posts instead of their accounts.\nA way to realize this is to provide each user with a secret identity, and every one of their posts is secretly linked to that identity. Unlike the example with the Wikipedia users, there is not a public pseudonym connected to them, and their identity remains hidden even from the service provider. Whenever a user wants to post they have to prove that none of the flagged posts are linked to their identity, without leaking any information about it.\nA savvy reader (you) can spot an immediate problem; how can we prevent users from making many different accounts? This is a common network service attack called the Sybil Attack.&nbsp; In a “normal” system, users have to register through an identity provider (e.g., Google) using some identifier (e.g., their Gmail account). To solve this problem, blocklisting schemes can also utilize identity providers who would maintain a log of “registered users”. Hence, when a user posts, they have to also prove they are registered without revealing it’s them posting, using magic cryptography.\nTo summarize, anonymous blocklisting systems achieve blocking anonymous users without the need to deanonymize them. They allow users to post anonymously (even to the service provider), while service providers can block individual posts without any of the user’s information getting leaked.\nCryptographic Protocols\nTo delve deeper into the mechanics of anonymous blocklisting schemes, we’ll go over some cryptographic protocols that help ensure the users’ privacy.\nZK-SNARKs\nThe main building block needed to build an anonymous blocklisting scheme is called a zk-SNARK; Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge. Even if it is a mouthful, every single property is necessary. Let’s break them down together below. Assume we have two parties denoted as the Prover and the Verifier.\n\nArgument of Knowledge: A SNARK is a proof1 where the Prover can prove their possession of some information to the Verifier. Typically, the “information” is the solution (“witness”) to a computational problem that the Verifier could not solve by themselves.\nNon-Interactive: The communication between the two parties solely consists of a single proof message sent from the Prover to the Verifier (in more general models, the Verifier and Prover could engage in multiple rounds of interactive communication).\nSuccinct: The Prover’s message should be small compared to their witness.\nZero-Knowledge: The Prover manages to prove possession of their witness without revealing any information about the witness itself.\n\nThe crux of the whole protocol is the zero-knowledge property which can accompany a SNARK. To make Zero - Knowledge more tangible we can revisit one of the most overdone examples in the history of ZK, drawing from the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender2. Imagine our Prover is Aang, and our Verifier is Toph. Aang has two different colored boomerangs (one red and one green) and wants to prove to Toph who is (color)blind that they are indeed different colors. However, Aang doesn’t want to let Toph know which boomerang is which color! Thankfully, they came up with the following Zero-Knowledge Protocol: Toph holds the boomerangs behind her back. She briefly displays one of the two boomerangs before hiding it again. She then again chooses one of the two at random, brings it out, and asks “Did I switch the boomerangs?”. Of course, Toph knows if she displayed the same or a different boomerang, and Aang can easily differentiate given their different colors. If Aang lies, he will only succeed 50% of the time. By repeating the protocol multiple times, Toph can be convinced, without actually learning any information about the individual boomerang’s colors!\n\n\nOf course in this example, even though we demonstrate the ZK property, this is not a SNARK since it is interactive. With a ZK-SNARK, Toph and Aang would not need multiple rounds of communication.\nSignature Schemes\nAnother cryptographic protocol required to understand anonymous blocklisting is a signature scheme. A digital signature, just like a real-life signature, gives a Prover the ability to sign a message before sending it. Then a Verifier, using some public information, can verify that the Prover was the one who sent that message. Signature Schemes consist of 3 algorithms:\n\nGeneration Algorithm: It produces a signature (secret) key sk only known by the signer and a verification key vk public to everyone.\nSigning Algorithm: Given a message m and the secret key sk, it produces the digital signature σ.\nVerification Algorithm: Given the public verification key vk, the original message m and the signature σ, it produces 1 if the signature is valid and 0 if it’s not.\n\nSignature schemes allow users to authenticate the origin and integrity of a message. Let’s understand their importance through another Avatar example, where Zuko is trying to capture the Avatar2. Imagine Zuko wants to announce to the world online, and as an extension his dad -the Firelord-, that he caught the Avatar. However, anyone can try and give false information, impersonating Zuko, and claim the Avatar has been caught. To avoid this scenario, Zuko sets up a digital signature scheme; he runs the Generation algorithm and shares the (public) verification key with his dad before his trip. Now, if he catches the Avatar, he can publish his message “I caught the Avatar, and with him, my honor”, along with a signature σ. As a result, the Firelord can run the (public) verification algorithm, which would return true if this message is truly from Zuko, or false, indicating it did not, in fact, come from Zuko.\n\nCommitment Schemes\nWe will also encounter a commitment scheme, which allows one to commit to a specific value while keeping it hidden from everyone else. In addition, the committed value can be revealed later without any possibility of alteration. This ensures both confidentiality and integrity, ensuring that the committed value is securely locked and that after revealing it, the original commitment and the revealed value match perfectly. Commitment schemes consist of the following two phases, which take place between a committer and a receiver:\n\nThe commit phase, during which the committer chooses and commits to a value by producing a “commitment” message.\nThe reveal phase, during which the committer sends the value to the receiver along with a “decommitment” message (e.g. the randomness used in the commit phase), and the receiver can verify its authenticity.\n\nCommitment schemes have to satisfy two properties:\n\nHiding property: Given a commitment, no information about the committed value can be extracted.\nBinding Property: The value chosen in the commit phase is the only one that the commitment can decommit to.\n\nAssume that Aang and Toph are playing a game where Toph thinks of a number between 1 and 10, and Aang tries to guess it. They want to ensure that Toph cannot change her pick after Aang makes his guess, so they use a commitment scheme. Toph thinks of the number 7 and sends a commitment to Aang. Then Aang makes his guess and says: “I think the number is 5”. Finally, Toph reveals her pick by sending a decommitment message. Due to the properties of the commitment scheme, Aang cannot cheat and get any information about Toph’s number before the reveal phase. At the same time, if Aang guessed 7 correctly, Toph cannot lie about her initial pick claiming it was a different number.\n\nPseudorandom Functions (PRFs)\nThe last protocol we will refer to is a pseudorandom function, or PRF. A PRF is a function that takes as input a key and a message, and returns a random-looking string: PRK(key, message) = pseudorandom string. A PRF must have the following two properties:\n\nIt is easy to compute (i.e., in polynomial time).\nOne cannot distinguish between random strings and the results of a PRF without access to the key.\n\nIn other words, randomness is expensive; PRFs are cryptography’s efficient way of faking randomness.\nAnonymous Blocklisting\nWe will now focus on anonymous blocklisting schemes, starting with their necessary properties and continue by doing a survey of state-of-the-art systems SNARKBlock and its predecessor BLAC.\nOverall, in an Anonymous Blocklisting Scheme, there is a blocklist filled with flagged posts. Every user gets a “secret identity” when they register for the service. Every time they want to post, they have to produce a token that is linked to their identity, and then prove both that they are registered and that none of the flagged posts were made by them. To do that, as we will see later, they can use zero-knowledge proofs, attesting to the fact that their identity is valid (produced during the registration) and that it is not connected to any of the posts in the blocklist, without revealing any actual information about their identity.\nDefinition\nWe will begin with a simplified definition of anonymous blocklisting schemes due to Henry and Goldberg that can be generalized to most existing blocklisting schemes.\n\nThe parties involved are the following:\n\nUsers: The set of individuals using the service are called users. All users are assigned to a random unique identifier k, which constitutes their identity and remains secret.\nIdentity Providers: Every user has to connect to an identity provider (e.g., Google) to register for the service and acquire a new and valid identity.\nService Providers: The entity (or entities) providing the service (e.g., Wikipedia).\nRevocation Authorities: The authority responsible for flagging content and blocking users. For the context of this blog, we assume the service providers also play the role of the revocation authorities, which is the case for most blocklisting schemes.\n\nThe protocols that can take place in an anonymous blocklisting scheme are:\n\nRegistration Protocol: This protocol takes place between a user and an identity provider and happens once so that the user registers for the service. By running this algorithm, the user receives a valid unique identifier.\nToken Extraction Protocol: For a user to take action on the service (e.g., post), they need an authentication token. By running this protocol with their unique identifier, they can obtain a token secretly linked to their identity. This process ensures that the token can be used for authentication while preventing anyone from gaining information about the user's identity by merely observing the token.\n\nAuthorization Protocol: In this protocol, the service provider takes as input an authentication token and verifies that the user is eligible to use the service (i.e., not blocked).\nRevocation Protocol: This protocol is run by the service provider, taking as input an authorization token and blocking the user by adding the token to the blocklist.\nReinstatement Protocol: Similarly to the revocation protocol, the service provider can also unban a user by removing their token from the blocklist.\n\nThe crux of the anonymous blocklisting scheme is ensuring the following three security requirements:\n\n\nBlocklistability: Users can successfully authenticate to an honest service provider only if that user holds a valid identity not in the blocklist issued by an identity provider: Specifically, it encompasses the following two notions:\n\nVerification should succeed only on authentication tokens that are the result of a user correctly executing the established protocols.\nGiven an authentication token issued to some anonymous user, a service provider can have the user’s access revoked, such that they cannot post again until all his banned tokens are removed.\n\n\n\nAnonymity: No information about the user can be linked to an authentication token, which encompasses the following two notions:\n\nGiven an authentication token from one of two users, it should be infeasible for an attacker to determine which user that authentication token was issued to.\nGiven two or more authentication tokens, it should be infeasible for an attacker to distinguish if they came from the same user or two different ones.\n\n\n\nNon-frameability: An honest user cannot be prevented from being authenticated by an honest service provider.\n\n\nLet’s go back to our example setting2 to better better the mechanics of such a scheme. Imagine that the officials of the city of Ba Sing Se have set up an anonymous forum of people sharing secrets from their everyday lives, like the app Whisper, and Joo Dee is an identity provider. Assume that Aang wants to subscribe to the forum and make posts. He first has to get in contact with Joo Dee to register. As an outcome, he gains a unique identifier k, secret even to Joo Dee. Then, assume he wants to post the message “There is war in Ba Sing Se”. He runs the token extraction protocol using his identifier to get a token α and anonymously sends the message along with the token to the city officials. Now they run the Authentication Protocol, verify that the message is not coming from a banned user, and publish it.\nOf course, it’s not long before the message gets flagged for harmful content. So the authorities run the revocation algorithm using that token. Now, if Aang tries to post again with a new token, it won’t be authorized. However, no one can link his message to him or any of his futile attempts to post again.\n\nInefficient Constructions\nAs usual in cryptography, things in practice are a little different, and by different, I mean worse. The security requirements explained above are necessary but not sufficient for a useful in-practice anonymous blocklisting scheme. The size of the blocklist can grow extremely fast depending on the use case.\nFor example, Wikipedia has approximately 2 edits per second and Reddit around 64 comments per second. Estimating from event logs from 2020, the ban rate for Wikipedia is around 1%, which would result in approximately 2 thousand bans in Wikipedia and 40 thousand bans for Reddit.\nWe thus need schemes that are efficient, both for the users and the service provider.\nOn the user’s side, to be efficient means that authenticating a token and using the service has a predictable runtime and bandwidth so as not to add too much latency to their requests. On the service provider’s side, we need both the authentication and revocation processes to have predictable running times and bandwidth, so that the cost of servicing a user is not too high and the system can keep up with the expected rate of revocations.\nLet’s start with a construction inspired by the first anonymous blocklisting scheme with a Trusted Third Party, BLAC by Tsang et al., to delve deeper into the mechanics3.\nConsider the blocklist as a set of tokens, where every token is of the form (nonce, PRF(k, nonce)) for some random number nonce and someone’s unique identifier k.\nThe registration protocol has to take place once, before the user can access the service. The user randomly chooses his credential k, then computes and sends a commitment com(k) to the identity provider. The identity provider answers with a signature σ on that commitment.\nDuring the token extraction protocol, the user randomly chooses a value nonce and computes a token α = (nonce, PRF(k, nonce)), tying the token with their identity.\nThe authorization protocol works as follows: the user sends to the service a token α, along with a zk-SNARK that: (i) the token is computed correctly and is equal to PRF(k, nonce), (ii) they have a well-formed commitment com(k) such that it is signed from an identity provider and (iii) none of the tokens in the blocklist are related to the user’s identifier, i.e.  for all α=(nonce′, h) in the blocklist,&nbsp; PRF(k, nonce′) ≠ h.\nThen, in the verification protocol the service provider checks that the proofs are valid (i.e., the user is not blocked), and only then offers their service.\nFinally, for the revocation protocol, if the service provider notices harmful content, they add the token accompanying it in the blocklist. Respectively, they can remove it if they decide to unban them by running the reinstatement protocol.\nIt is clear to see the security of this protocol:\n\n\nThe scheme satisfies blocklistablity since, if a user is blocked or tries to use fake credentials, their zk-SNARK wouldn’t verify. That is, there would either be a token in the blocklist connected to their unique identifier k, or they wouldn’t have a valid signature on the commitment of their identifier. Also, because of the binding property of the commitment scheme, they cannot connect a different value to the signed commitment σ from the identity provider. At the same time, the service provider can block any user by adding their corresponding token to the blocklist.\n\n\nThe scheme is also anonymous, since all the information sent to the service provider is through a zk-SNARK, revealing no information about the user. In addition, due to the hiding property of the commitment scheme, the identity provider also never learns anything about the user’s identity.\n\n\nAs far as non-frameability goes, for an honest user to be prevented from using the service, one would have to produce a token that would tie to the user’s unique identifier, impossible given the pseudorandomness of the PRF.\n\n\nHowever, there is an immediate efficiency flaw in the above construction; the server has to do linear work in the size of the blocklist to verify a user since the proof goes over the whole blocklist every time. At the same time, the proof sizes are also linear in the size of the blocklist. In BLAC, a single proof for a blocklist with 4 million blocks (a size that according to our previous estimations, Reddit would reach in approximately 100 days) would require a client to upload 549MiB of data. Overall, existing zk-SNARK implementations are fit to only handle pieces of the blocklist efficiently.\nSNARKBlock\nEnters SNARKBlock, a new anonymous blocklisting scheme from Rosenberg et al. The authors build upon the aforementioned construction and can offer proofs that are only logarithmic in the size of the blocklist, while also requiring logarithmic verification time.\nBlocklists mostly stay immutable and the service provider adds to them. As a result, both the service provider and the users end up recomputing a lot of the information. More specifically, if a user has calculated a proof for a blocklist with 99 blocked posts, after a new post gets added they have to calculate a new proof for all 100 posts.\nThe authors break up the blocklist into non-overlapping chunks so that users can reuse their proof computation over the unchanged chunks. Then they can combine all the distinct proofs into one logarithmic-sized proof (in relation to the blocklist size).\nSo for our example, we could separate the blocklist into 10 chunks and only have to recompute the proof for the last 10 blocked posts.\nThere are two immediate problems with the above technique. To begin with, in the original protocol, the proof that was attesting to the validity of the user posting was taking as input the user’s unique identifier as a witness, making sure that they have not posted any of the blocked posts. What happens though with proofs for different chunks? Each proof would have to take as input the witnesses anew, and a malicious user could potentially have a different identity for a specific chunk, bypassing the block.\nAnother less obvious problem is the need for rerandomization over the proofs. Reusing a proof for a specific chunk can reveal information that connects the user with previous posts. There are indeed SNARK proofs that allow rerandomization, like the Groth16 scheme used in SNARKBlock. Nevertheless, the same cannot be said when presenting multiple proofs with a common hidden input.\nBoth of these problems are solved with the introduction of HICIAP.\nHICIAP\nThe main contribution of SNARKBlock is a new type of zero-knowledge proof, called HIdden Common Input Aggregate Proofs, or HICIAP (pronounced “high-chop”). With HICIAP, one can aggregate many zk-SNARKs (specifically Groth16 proofs) of the same relation into a single logarithmic-sized proof and show that they all share a common hidden input. At the same time, it is possible to link multiple HICIAP proofs of different relations, showing in a zero-knowledge proof that those inputs are equal. For our setting, this means that we can (i) have different proofs for each chunk of the blocklist that we aggregate to a single proof and (ii) link that proof with the other distinct proofs to make sure the same secret identity was used for all of them.\nLet’s see now how SNARKBlock’s protocol differs from the BLAC-inspired inefficient construction. The authors separate the Authentication protocol into Sync, which is run by the user offline (i.e., before the authentication has to go through) performing necessary pre-computation, Attest, where the user produces and sends the token along with a zk-SNARK to prove eligibility, and Verify, where the service provider finally authenticates the user if the SNARK verifies correctly. Overall, the user can gather all the different proofs for each chunk and wrap them in a HICIAP proof, proving they share a common input. Later they can link this HICIAP proof with the rest of the proofs related to honest token extraction and registration.\nMore specifically, in Sync, the user starts by fetching the most recent version of the blocklist and its division into chunks. Then they compute:\n\na proof \\( \\pi_{chunk_i} \\) for each chunk of the blocklist that was altered or updated, proving that the user’s unique identifier is not correlated with any of the blocks in that chunk; i.e., if the user’s identifier is k, for all blocks α = (nonce′, h) in the chunk, PRF(k, nonce′) ≠ h\na proof \\( \\pi_{isu} \\) attesting to having registered, i.e. having a witness for a commitment signed by the identity provider\n\nWhen it’s time to use the service, the Attest protocol takes place. The user does the following:\n\ncomputes a proof \\(\\pi_{token}\\) after they have extracted a token α, to prove that the token was computed honestly using their unique identifier k, α = (nonce, PRF(k, nonce))\nwraps the \\( {\\pi_{chunk_i}} \\) proofs for all chunks, \\( \\pi_{isu} \\) and \\(\\pi_{token}\\) proofs into HICIAP proofs \\( \\hat{\\pi_{chunk}} \\), \\( \\hat{\\pi_{isu}} \\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi_{token}}\\) respectively\nproduces a proof \\( {\\pi_{link}} \\) that all of the aforementioned HICIAP proofs share the same witness, their unique identifier k\nsends \\( \\hat{\\pi_{chunk}} \\), \\( \\hat{\\pi_{isu}} \\), \\(\\hat{\\pi_{token}}\\) and \\( {\\pi_{link}} \\) to the service provider.\n\nFinally, the service provider checks the validity of the proofs during the Verification part.\nEfficiency\nAs noted before, SNARKBlock is much faster than BLAC, since both the verification time and proof size become logarithmic instead of linear in the size of the blocklist. In BLAC, a blocklist with 4 million bans would require a proof of 549MiB, whereas a SNARKBlock attestation for the same size blocklist is only 130KiB, making it feasible for use without elaborate hardware! But does this automatically make SNARKBlock efficient enough to be used in practice? We also cannot forget the extra cost SNARKBlock introduces: offline synchronization.\nHere we can see the authors’ evaluation of different-sized blocklists. These include the synchronization time depending on how much the blocklist was altered, the attestation time (which translates to how much time the user takes to produce a proof), the verification time on the service provider’s side, and the size of the proof, with or without the use of different sized buffers4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n SNARKBlock's evaluation from the paper: (top left) synchronization time depending on blocklist alterations, (top right) attestation time, (bottom left) verification time, and (bottom right) proof size depending on the blocklist size.\n\nMore specifically, the top left figure shows the offline computation a client must do as a function of the number of changes to the blocklist. This includes syncing chunks and precomputing a proof that they are registered through an identity provider. We can see that the offline precomputation can take up to a couple of minutes for a large number of additions. Since the user can perform it asynchronously and periodically, it doesn’t introduce any significant overhead.\nThe top right figure shows the time clients take to attest to non-membership on a blocklist that has recently changed. This is the time it takes for a user to recompute the last chunk proof and link them all together. These results can be interpreted differently considering the different services that SNARKBlock can be used for; if the time to write a message and send it to get posted is smaller than the authentication time (a few seconds here) then the message would get queued. These times seem to be acceptable for forums primarily focused on posting and commenting anonymously. However, the results are impractical for implementations like real-time chat forums, where speed is of the essence and attestation needs to be on the order of milliseconds.\nThe two bottom graphs show the throughput and proof sizes for server verification. These graphs are in a semi-log scale and do in fact show that SNARKBlock proofs scale logarithmically with the number of elements in the blocklist, both in terms of size and time efficiency on the server’s side.\n\nConclusion\nAnonymous communication systems protect user privacy but face challenges in managing inappropriate behavior. Anonymous blocklisting schemes, powered by advanced cryptographic protocols like zk-SNARKs, enable blocking individual posts without revealing user identities. These schemes use signature and commitment schemes, along with pseudorandom functions, to maintain privacy while ensuring message authenticity.\nSNARKBlock addresses inefficiencies in traditional systems by introducing HIdden Common Input Aggregate Proofs (HICIAP), which aggregate multiple proofs into a single efficient proof. This innovation achieves logarithmic proof sizes and verification times in relation to the size of the blocklist, making anonymous blocklisting practical for some large-scale applications, such as social media platforms.\nHowever, further advancements are needed to fully realize a world where anonymous blocklisting schemes are seamlessly deployed and used in everyday applications. Future steps include examining the use of Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) or recursion techniques in order to recursively combine many proofs into one, and thus further reduce proof sizes and verification times.\nAdditionally, minimizing the cost of reinstating users without major recomputation is a key challenge that needs addressing to make the schemes more adaptable and user-friendly.\nFinally, it is crucial to explore interoperability to ensure that anonymous blocklisting schemes can be seamlessly integrated with existing communication platforms and systems.\nBy tackling these challenges, we can move closer to using anonymous blocklisting in everyday digital communication.\n1\nTechnically this is the wrong terminology. The difference between a “proof” and an “argument” in cryptography lies in their soundness definition, which refers to the truthfulness of the protocol: if the statement is false, no Prover can convince a Verifier of the opposite. Proofs have statistical soundness (holds against an unbounded adversary), whereas arguments have only computational soundness (holds against a polynomially bounded adversary). For easier understanding, we can mislabel a SNARK, secure against bounded adversaries, as a “proof”.\n\n2\nIn the world of Avatar, Aang (who is the Avatar) and Toph are part of a team trying to defend the Earth Kingdom against the Fire Nation, led by the Firelord and his son, Zuko. They end up in the city of Ba Sing Se (where Joo Dee resides) which has an authoritarian government refusing to acknowledge that a war is happening.\n\n3\nWhile the described scheme has the same general mechanics as BLAC, it is presented in a simplified form that is closer to the SNARKBlock scheme for easier understanding.

This optimization aims to fix the problem when the blocklist might be updated during the Sync process, resulting in recomputation during the Attest process and thus added latency. So they use a buffer of smaller chunks at the end of the list and a separate HICIAP instance to process them, which increases the number of distinct proofs but reduces the overall attestation time.\n\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/anonymous-blocklisting/","title":"Efficient Anonymous Blocklisting"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/atlas/":{"body":"TL; DR\n\nThe workload of state-vector quantum circuit simulation is massively parallel. Most quantum gates multiply one small matrix to many vectors, and the workload is balanced.\nChallenge: the state vector is too large to be stored on one GPU, and the communication cost is very high. We want to keep the computation local.\nAtlas, using a hierarchical partitioning approach consisting of circuit staging and kernelization (i.e., partitioning the circuit into stages and then into GPU kernels), outperforms state-of-the-art distributed GPU simulators by more than \\(2\\times\\).\nIn circuit staging, an ILP algorithm minimizes the number of stages to minimize communication cost.\nIn circuit kernelization, a DP algorithm outperforms previous greedy approaches by allowing for more gate reorderings.\nBoth circuit staging and circuit kernelization played an important role in improving the performance.\n\nBackground: Quantum Circuit Simulation\nIntroduction\nIn the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum computers are a scarce resource, and they suffer from decoherence and lack of error correction. Therefore, there is significant interest in quantum circuit simulation which enables performing robust quantum computation on classical parallel machine, and helps develop and debug quantum algorithms.\nThere are many methods to simulate quantum circuits. This blog post focuses on the state-vector (Schrödinger style) simulation, the most general, straightforward, and well-studied approach. Some other techniques for noise-free accurate quantum circuit simulation include:\n\nFeynman-path simulation, which is good for sparse circuits;\nTensor network simulation, which is good for circuits with low entanglement;\nStabilizer simulation, which is good for Clifford circuits.\n\nThese methods are usually used for circuits with certain structures, or circuits with too many qubits (&gt; 40) that are beyond the capability of state-vector simulation. For general circuits with good “quantumness” (hard to simulate using a classical computer), state-vector simulation is usually the most efficient approach. Our work aims to make it even more efficient.\nQuantum State and State Vector\nState-vector simulation features a direct representation of the quantum state. The state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) of an \\(n\\)-qubit quantum circuit can be represented by a superposition of its basis states denoted \\(\\ket{0\\dots 00}\\), \\(\\ket{0\\dots 01}\\), …, \\(\\ket{1\\dots 11}\\), written as\n$$\n\\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \\alpha_i \\ket{i},\n$$\nwhere \\(\\alpha_i\\) is a complex coefficient (also called amplitude) of the basis state \\(\\ket{i}\\), and \\(i\\) is in its binary representation. When measuring the state of the system in the computational basis, the probability of observing the state \\(\\ket{i}\\) as the output is \\(|\\alpha_i|^2\\), and therefore \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} |\\alpha_i|^2 = 1\\). A quantum state of \\( n \\) qubits is then represented by the state vector\n$$\n(\\alpha_{0\\dots 00},\\alpha_{0\\dots 01},…,\\alpha_{1\\dots 11})^\\top,\n$$\na unit vector of size \\( 2^n \\). For example, a 2-qubit state vector is written as\n$$\n(\\alpha_{00},\\alpha_{01},\\alpha_{10},\\alpha_{11})^\\top.\n$$\nQuantum Gates: Applying Operations to State Vectors\nIn quantum computing, computation is specified using quantum gates. Quantum gates are unitary operators that transform the state vector. The semantics of a \\(k\\)-qubit gate is specified by a \\(2^k \\times 2^k\\) unitary complex matrix \\(U\\), and applying the gate to a quantum state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) results in a state denoted by the state vector \\(U \\ket{\\psi}\\).\nIf the quantum gate only operates on a part of qubits, we need to compute the tensor product before performing the matrix multiplication. For example, when applying the single-qubit gate\n$$\nU_1(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; e^{i\\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nto the first qubit (the less significant bit in the state index) of a 2-qubit state, the computation becomes\n$$\n(U_1(\\theta) \\otimes I) \\ket{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; e^{i\\theta} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; e^{i\\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha_{00}\\\\\n\\alpha_{01}\\\\\n\\alpha_{10}\\\\\n\\alpha_{11}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nYou may have realized that we don’t actually have to explicitly compute the tensor product – we can compute two \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix-vector multiplications for the \\((\\alpha_{00}, \\alpha_{01})^\\top\\) and \\((\\alpha_{10}, \\alpha_{11})^\\top\\) parts in parallel. And yes, each \\(k\\)-qubit gate only requires \\(2^{n-k}\\) copies of \\(2^k \\times 2^k \\) parallel matrix-vector multiplications.\nState-vector simulation simply computes these matrix-vector multiplications on classical machines. Given such high parallelism (quantum gates are typically either single-qubit or two-qubit), it is natural to use GPUs, or more precisely, distributed GPUs for state-vector simulation when the exponential-sized state vector exceeds the memory limit of a single GPU.\nUsing distributed GPUs, however, inevitably incurs a high communication cost. In the following section, let’s go through the setup of quantum circuit simulation on distributed GPUs and the causes of communications.\nSetup\nArchitectural Model\nWe assume a multi-node GPU architecture with \\(2^G\\) computation nodes. We present two variants of computation nodes: the first one is each node contains \\(2^R\\) GPUs, and each GPU can store \\(2^L\\) amplitudes (complex numbers), and the second one is each node contains some GPUs and a CPU with DRAM that can store \\(2^{L+R}\\) amplitudes. For simplicity, let’s focus on the first variant first, where we can store the entire state vector of size\n$$\n2^n = 2^{G+R+L}\n$$\non the GPUs. We will discuss the DRAM offloading variant at the end of this blog post.\nLocal, Regional, and Global Qubits\nThe reason why the number of computation nodes \\(2^G\\), number of GPUs per node \\(2^R\\), and the GPU memory size \\(2^L\\) are all powers of two is that we can then associate the parameters with the qubits: suppose there are \\(G\\) global qubits, \\(R\\) regional qubits, and \\(L\\) local qubits. We can simulate quantum circuits of \\(n = L + R + G\\) qubits. If there are fewer qubits (\\(n\\) is smaller), we can set \\(G = n - L - R\\), and use fewer GPU nodes.\nThe following figure shows an example data layout of a state vector of 5 qubits on 2 nodes with 2 GPUs in each node. Suppose the qubits are indexed \\(q_4 q_3 q_2 q_1 q_0 \\) in the state vector indices at the bottom of the figure. There is \\(G = 1\\) global qubit \\(q_4\\), \\(R = 1\\) regional qubit \\(q_3\\), and \\(L = 3\\) local qubits \\(q_2, q_1, q_0\\). Node 0 stores the shards where the global qubit \\(q_4 = \\ket{0}\\), and GPU 0 stores the shard where the global qubit \\(q_4\\) and the regional qubit \\(q_3\\) are both \\(\\ket{0}\\).\n\nSimulating Quantum Gates on GPUs\n“Local” Gates\nTo simulate a quantum gate operating only on local qubits, we only need intra-GPU communication. For example, let’s see how to simulate the CNOT gate highlighted in yellow in the figure below. CNOT, or controlled-NOT gate, has a control qubit (denoted by the small circle) and a target qubit (denoted by the large circle with a plus sign in it). It corresponds to the matrix\n$$\nCNOT = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe gate does nothing when the control qubit is \\(\\ket{0}\\), or applies the NOT operation (flipping \\(\\ket{0}\\) to \\(\\ket{1}\\), and \\(\\ket{1}\\) to \\(\\ket{0}\\)) to the target qubit when the control qubit is \\(\\ket{1}\\). In the following circuit, the control qubit is \\(q_1\\), and the target qubit is \\(q_0\\). So, executing this gate is equivalent to swapping the amplitudes of \\(q_0 = \\ket{0}\\) and \\(q_0 = \\ket{1}\\) when \\(q_1 = \\ket{1}\\). The pattern of these swaps is shown in the orange curves on the left of the figure above. There is only intra-GPU communication when we execute this CNOT gate, and this property holds for any gate operating entirely on local qubits.\n\nDo Not Execute “Non-Local” Gates\nIf a gate operates on non-local qubits, things become different. For example, the Hadamard gate on \\(q_4\\), denoted by the letter H, would multiply a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix to each of the 16 vectors in\n$$\n\\binom{\\alpha_{00000}}{\\alpha_{10000}}, \\binom{\\alpha_{00001}}{\\alpha_{10001}}, \\dots, \\binom{\\alpha_{01111}}{\\alpha_{11111}}\n$$\nfor the state vector \\((\\alpha_{00000}, \\dots, \\alpha_{11111})^\\top\\). This incurs fine-grained inter-GPU (and even inter-node because \\(q_4\\) is a global qubit) communication at each and every entry of the state vector. This is very expensive, and we want to avoid executing such global gates by choosing the local qubit set carefully. In fact, it would be better to partition the circuit into stages, with a different local qubit set for each stage, so that all gates only operate on local qubits in each stage, and communication only happens between stages.\nException: Insular Qubits\nIn fact, not all “non-local” gates are expensive. We call the non-local qubits in a gate that can be executed efficiently insular qubits. Insular qubits include the following two cases:\n\nFor a single-qubit gate, the qubit is insular if the unitary matrix of the gate is diagonal or anti-diagonal.\nFor a multi-qubit controlled gate, control qubits are insular.\n\nFor example, the last CNOT gate highlighted in blue in the figure above has a non-local control qubit \\(q_3\\) and a local target qubit \\(q_2\\). We can execute this gate efficiently by sending different instructions to different GPUs. Since the control qubit is non-local, we know if it is \\(\\ket{0}\\) or \\(\\ket{1}\\) from the GPU number. We can then lower the CNOT gate into a NOT gate when \\(q_3 = \\ket{1}\\) on GPUs 1 and 3, and do nothing when \\(q_3 = \\ket{0}\\) on GPUs 0 and 2.\nThis property allows Atlas to only consider the non-insular qubits of quantum gates when mapping qubits.\nPutting these together, an algorithm seems ready to come out: iteratively execute as many local gates as possible that do not require inter-GPU communication, and then shard the state vector (remap the qubits) to make sure the next group of gates does not require inter-GPU communication. In this way, the communication cost is largely reduced. The following section introduces the entire picture of Atlas.\nHierarchical Partitioning Overview\n\nThis figure shows an example application of circuit partitioning and execution. We stage the circuit so that (non-insular) qubits of each gate map to local qubits (i.e., green lines in each stage). The notation \\(q_i[p_j]\\) indicates that the \\(i\\)-th logical qubit maps to the \\(j\\)-th physical qubit (data layout). We then partition the gates of each stage into kernels for data parallelism. After partitioning into kernels, we execute the kernels on each GPU. Each GPU executes a shard of the state vector. Between each stage, we shard the state vector again via all-to-all communication between GPU pairs.\nCircuit Staging\nPrevious works relied on greedy heuristics for circuit staging, but we realize that the communication cost is so high that it’s worthwhile to use a provable algorithm for optimal circuit staging. Here is the problem formulation: given parameters \\(L, R, G\\), partition the circuit into stages to minimize the total communication cost such that each stage has \\(L\\) local qubits, \\(R\\) regional qubits, and \\G\\)global qubits, subject to the constraint that all non-insular qubits of all gates only operate on local qubits.\nBecause the sharding operation to remap the state vector with a different local qubit set is very expensive, and it is implemented by qubit swaps (the running time is positively correlated with the number of qubit pairs to be swapped), we optimize for the following objective:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{s-1} \\left(\\left|\\mathcal{Q}_i^{local} \\setminus \\mathcal{Q}_{i-1}^{local}\\right| + c \\cdot \\left|\\mathcal{Q}_i^{global} \\setminus \\mathcal{Q}_{i-1}^{global}\\right|\\right).\n$$\nwhere \\(s\\) is the total number of stages, \\(c\\) is a pre-set inter-node communication cost factor (we use 3 in our evaluation), \\(\\mathcal{Q}_i^{local}\\) is the local qubit set of stage \\(i\\), and \\(\\mathcal{Q}_i^{global}\\) is the global qubit set of stage \\(i\\). \\(|\\mathcal{Q}_i^{local} \\setminus \\mathcal{Q}_{i-1}^{local}|\\) is the number of local qubits that need to be updated, approximating the inter-GPU communication cost; \\(|\\mathcal{Q}_i^{global} \\setminus \\mathcal{Q}_{i-1}^{global}| \\) is the number of global qubits that need to be updated, approximating the extra inter-node communication cost.\nWe design a binary Integer Linear Programming (ILP) algorithm to discover a staging strategy that minimizes the total communication cost. We loop over \\(s\\) from \\(1, 2 \\dots\\), to try to solve the ILP for \\(s\\) stages. The core variables in the ILP algorithms are:\n\n\\(A_{q,k}\\in {0,1}\\): If the qubit \\(q\\) is local at the stage \\(k\\);\n\\(B_{q,k}\\in {0,1}\\): If the qubit \\(q\\) is global at the stage \\(k\\);\n\\(F_{g,k}\\in {0,1}\\): If the gate \\(g\\) is executed by the end of stage \\(k\\).\n\nUsing some ancillary variables, we can formulate the objective and constraints in the ILP.\nIn conclusion, on top of the minimum number of stages, the ILP minimizes the total communication cost.\nCircuit Kernelization\nNow that we’ve partitioned the circuit into stages, let’s execute each stage in GPU kernels. A straightforward way to execute gates is to create one kernel for each gate, but this incurs a high kernel launch overhead. A natural way to improve the performance is through kernel fusion, but it may amplify the computation exponentially. For example, if we fuse single-qubit gates on \\(k\\) qubits together, the matrix size becomes \\(2^k \\times 2^k\\). Compared to \\(k\\) times of \\(2 \\times 2 \\) matrix multiplying to \\(2^{n-1}\\) vectors of size \\(2\\) each, multiplying a single \\(2^k \\times 2^k\\) matrix to \\(2^{n-k}\\) vectors of size \\(2^k\\) each would increase the computation by \\(2^{k-1} / k \\) times. Note that the computation workload is tiny, so this is not to say that we should not perform kernel fusion – fusing 4-5 qubits is beneficial because it reduces kernel launch overhead, but fusing 20 qubits, for example, is not favorable.\nAnother way to improve the performance is to load the state vector into the GPU shared memory in batches, and then execute quantum gates sequentially in the shared memory. This is efficient for each gate, but it pays an overhead for loading and storing the state vector, and can only execute gates on a few qubits depending on the shared memory size.\nWe propose a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm for circuit kernelization. Given a cost function for kernels and a circuit sequence \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) in a stage, we would like to partition \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) into kernels \\(\\mathcal{K}_0, \\dots, \\mathcal{K}_{b-1}\\) that minimizes the total execution cost\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{b-1}Cost(\\mathcal{K}_i).\n$$\nTo achieve the best kernelization result, we would like to allow for gate reordering in the sequence. The DP state \\(DP[i, \\kappa]\\) represents an ordered kernel set \\(\\kappa\\) for the first \\(i\\) gates in the gate sequence. However, we cannot partition the gates arbitrarily. The following figure shows an infeasible kernel schedule because the two blue dotted kernels are not “convex”.\n\nTo allow for gate reordering while not introducing infeasible kernel schedules, we present the following two constraints for the kernels to be considered by the algorithm:\n\nWeak convexity: \\(\\forall j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; j_3\\), if \\(\\mathcal{C}[j_1] \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{C}[j_2] \\notin \\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{C}[j_3] \\in \\mathcal{K}\\), then \\(Qubits(\\mathcal{C}[j_1])\\cap Qubits(\\mathcal{C}[j_2]) \\cap Qubits(\\mathcal{C}[j_3]) = \\emptyset\\).  Informally, weak convexity requires that for any three gates \\(\\mathcal{C}[j_1], \\mathcal{C}[j_2], \\mathcal{C}[j_3]\\), if only the middle gate is not in the kernel, then they cannot share a qubit.\nMonotonicity: If we decide to exclude a gate from \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) while it shares a qubit with \\(\\mathcal{K}\\), then we fix the qubit set of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) from that gate on.\n\nIn the figure above, the blue dotted kernel on the left violates weak convexity because \\(\\mathcal{C}[1]\\), \\(\\mathcal{C}[2]\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}[4]\\) share \\(q_2\\), and only \\(\\mathcal{C}[2]\\) is not in the kernel. If we allow this kernel to be considered, it will be mutually dependent with the kernel containing \\(\\mathcal{C}[2]\\), yielding no feasible results. The blue dotted kernel on the right does not violate weak convexity, but it violates monotonicity. \\(\\mathcal{C}[7]\\) is excluded from the kernel while sharing the qubit \\(q_1\\) with the kernel, so the qubit set of the kernel should be fixed to \\({q_0, q_1}\\). So it cannot include \\(\\mathcal{C}[9]\\). In fact, including \\(\\mathcal{C}[9]\\) in this kernel causes mutual dependency with the kernel \\({\\mathcal{C}[7],\\mathcal{C}[8]}\\).\nThese two constraints impose a low cost in implementation (in terms of the running time of the kernelization algorithm) while allowing for some gates to be reordered in the sequence. If you are interested in the implementation details of the DP algorithm, please check out our paper :)\nComparing with Previous Works\nWe compare our work Atlas with previous distributed GPU simulators HyQuas, cuQuantum, and Qiskit. They all store the entire state vector on GPUs. The following figure shows a weak scaling experiment on the circuit family of QFT, and all circuits in our benchmark of 11 quantum circuit families exhibit a similar pattern.\n\nHyQuas performs well when the number of GPUs is small, but it does not scale well when the number of GPUs is large. HyQuas also partition the circuit into kernels, but it uses a greedy approach: it packs gates into kernels of 4-7 qubits or uses a shared-memory kernel, greedily choosing the one with the best arithmetic density each time. cuQuantum, developed by NVIDIA, scales better than HyQuas, but it is slower and not as scalable as Atlas. cuQuantum uses a tailored function “custatevecMultiDeviceIndexBitSwaps” to minimize communication, but it does not focus on circuit kernelization: cuQuantum simply packs gates up to 4 or 5 qubits depending on the GPU model.\nIn summary, circuit staging and kernelization are both important.\nOn a benchmark of 99 circuits, Atlas is \\(4\\times\\) on average faster than HyQuas, \\(3.2\\times\\) on average faster than cuQuantum, and \\(286\\times\\) on average faster than Qiskit.\nDRAM Offloading\nIn addition to improving quantum circuit simulation performance, another key advantage of Atlas over existing systems is its ability to scale to larger circuits beyond the GPU memory capacity. Recall that we assumed that each computation node has \\(2^R\\) GPUs before. Instead, suppose we do not have that many GPUs, but only some GPUs and a CPU with DRAM that can store \\(2^{L+R}\\) amplitudes (complex numbers). In each stage, we will then have to run \\(2^R\\) shards of the state vector serially on one GPU by loading the shard from the DRAM, execute the kernels, and then store the shard back to DRAM each time (or let each GPU run \\(2^R / p\\) shards serially if we have \\(p\\) GPUs).\nWe compare Atlas with QDAO which is another GPU simulator using DRAM offloading to support larger circuits. The figure below (note that the \\(y\\)-axis is in log-scale) shows that Atlas runs \\(61\\times\\) faster than QDAO on average on the QFT circuits with 28-32 total qubits on a single GPU with 28 local qubits, and scales better.\n\nCircuit Staging &amp; Kernelization\nWe have also done evaluations on the circuit staging and kernelization algorithms, and they both achieve a significant improvement over prior approaches.\nFor circuit staging, we compare with SnuQS, which greedily selects the qubits with more gates operating on non-local gates in the current stage to form the next stage, and uses the number of total gates as a tiebreaker. Other works did not describe how the heuristics were implemented. The following figure shows the geometric mean number of stages for all 11 circuits with 31 qubits in our benchmark suite. Our circuit staging algorithm is guaranteed to return the minimum number of stages, and it always outperforms SnuQS’ approach.\n\nFor circuit kernelization, we compare with a baseline that greedily packs gates into fusion kernels of up to 5 qubits, the most cost-efficient kernel size in the cost function used in our experiment setting. Each circuit family exhibits a pattern, so we take the geometric mean of the cost for 9 circuits with the number of qubits from 28 to 36 for each circuit family. The following figure shows that the greedy baseline performs well in dj and qsvm circuits, but it does not generalize to other circuits. Our kernelization algorithm is able to exploit the pattern for each circuit and find a low-cost kernel sequence accordingly.\n\nConclusion\nWe have presented Atlas, an efficient and scalable Schrödinger-style distributed multi-GPU quantum circuit simulator. It uses a hierarchical partitioning approach with an ILP algorithm for circuit staging and a DP algorithm for kernelization, and significantly outperforms existing simulators.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/atlas/","title":"Atlas: Hierarchical Partitioning for Quantum Circuit Simulation on GPUs"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/boot/":{"body":"TL;DR\nBackground:\n\nOptimizing a database management system (DBMS) is difficult; the best configuration\ndepends on time-varying factors like its environment and workload.\nResearchers have developed machine learning (ML) models that outperform humans at these tasks.\nHowever, the cost (e.g., training time, dollars) of obtaining these models makes them\nimpractical for establishing an end-to-end database tuning loop.\nTo build these ML models, the DBMS must gather training data by collecting telemetry as it\nexecutes a workload.\nML techniques and model training keep getting faster and better.

hard to get.\nToday, weeks to collect data and minutes to train models – workload execution is the main\nbottleneck now!\n\n\n\nBig idea:\n\nTraining data collection is slow because the DBMS couples

speedups by eliminating repetition at the:\n\nInter-query level (macro-acceleration)\nIntra-query level (micro-acceleration)\nAt a modest cost to model accuracy, but tuning algorithms are surprisingly robust.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nDatabase management systems are hard to configure by hand.\nMachine learning models perform better.\n\n\nDatabase management systems (DBMSs) are challenging to optimize correctly because their ideal\nconfiguration depends on their workload, database contents, hardware, and run-time environment,\nwhich all fluctuate over time.\nTo address this difficulty, researchers have designed methods for automated DBMS configuration, in\none case obtaining 20% more\nperformance than the most skilled human.\nThe unifying goal of such research is to develop a\nself-driving DBMS\nthat configures, tunes, and optimizes itself automatically.\nGiven a target objective function (e.g., latency, throughput, cost), a self-driving DBMS aims to\nfind the best configuration for its objective autonomously.\nIt achieves this\nby relying on machine learning (ML) models that predict its run-time behavior under\ndifferent configurations.\nSuch models allow the DBMS to evaluate whether a candidate configuration is beneficial without\nexecuting the queries in its workload, which would be too expensive.\nFor example, the DBMS may need hours to complete a computationally intensive SQL query.\nIf the DBMS only needs the query’s run-time, it can achieve significant time savings by using a ML\nmodel to predict the query’s latency instead of running it.\nTo build its ML models, the DBMS collects\ntraining data\ncomprised of database metadata (e.g., optimizer statistics) and run-time telemetry\n(e.g., the latency of an operator in its query plan).\nIt generates this data by observing itself as it executes a\nrepresentative workload,\nsuch as an application trace of SQL queries.\nIt then constructs its models by applying ML\ntechniques.\n\nObtaining training data for ML models is expensive.\nEspecially when training data collection is not a one-time cost.\n\n\nHowever, the high cost of obtaining these models makes them impractical for real-world deployments.\nIn the past, the primary contributors to this cost were training data collection and model\nbuilding (collection time and training time, respectively).\nBut although ML techniques continue to improve and model construction becomes faster, training data\ncollection speeds have largely remained the same.\nToday, the ratio of collection time to training time is over 99% (e.g., weeks to collect data,\nminutes to train models).\nProblem 1: Training data is expensive to collect!\nFurthermore, unlike other ML domains that dismiss training data collection as a one-time cost\n(e.g., LLM researchers share model weights because their training data does not change as much),\nan autonomous DBMS needs training data\nspecific to its workload and configuration.\nReusing models from other deployments is challenging because the database’s contents, hardware,\nand system configuration influence its training data labels.\nFor example, the speed at which the DBMS’s sequential scan operator reads tuples from disk depends\non its hardware and configured buffer pool size.\nAdditionally, even if the DBMS already has models, they are often invalidated because of workload\ndrift, schema changes, dataset growth, and more.\nProblem 2: Training data is difficult to reuse!\nConsequently, an autonomous DBMS must regularly collect training data from scratch to maintain\nits ML models.\nDue to the high cost and frequency of training data generation, it often spends more time\ncollecting training data than improving its configuration.\nInsight\nDecoupling\n\nTraining data generation is slow because it is coupled to regular query execution.\nThis coupling is unnecessary, so we can obtain the same amount of training data much faster.\n\n\nTraining data generation is slow because it builds off the DBMS’s regular query execution.\nTo execute a SQL query, the DBMS uses its internal statistics to search for a query plan that\nefficiently computes the query’s answer.\nA query plan is a tree composed of the DBMS’s operators (e.g., sequential scans read a table\nfrom disk, hash joins combine the output of their children).\nThe DBMS executes the query plan by sending all tuples (i.e., rows of data) from the children\nnodes to their parent nodes, which computes the query’s result.\nBut training data generation differs from regular query execution because it concerns telemetry\n(e.g., timing information), not results (i.e., the tuples returned from a SQL query).\nA DBMS does not need accurate query results during this process.\nTherefore, it can accelerate its training data production if it can infer a workload’s telemetry\nwithout executing the workload to completion.\nThis inference is possible because a DBMS’s workload is repetitive at the query and operator level.\nQuery Repetition\n\nFor most workloads, the DBMS executes the same query template repeatedly.\nMany of those executions are redundant for training data generation.\n\n\nMost accesses to a DBMS are programmatic.\nSoftware (e.g., dashboards, reporting tools, web applications) generates most SQL queries\nfrom similar query templates, differing only in their input parameters.\nA query template is a normalized SQL string with its constants removed. For example,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Query: SELECT name FROM pets WHERE kind = ‘dog’ and name = ‘terrier’\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Template: SELECT name FROM pets WHERE kind = ‘$1’ and name = ‘$2’\nGiven the same template, a DBMS often generates an identical query plan; some DBMSs even cache\nquery plans by their corresponding template.\nThat is, they reuse the same query plan for different instantiations of a query template, leading\nto repetition in query execution.\nWorkload# Queries# TemplatesRepetition\nAdmissions2564M4060627k X\nBusTracker1223M3343.66M X\nMOOC95M885107k X\nTPC-H2000022909 X\nDSB1144052220 X\nStack500025200 X\n\n\nTable 1, Query Repetition:\n\nThe number of queries and query templates in the workloads used in recent ML approaches for\ndatabase tuning.\n\nWe observe that both real-world application traces and synthetic benchmarks exhibit high\nrepetition – the DBMS executes a small number of query templates hundreds, thousands, or even\nmillions of times.\nThis repetition is necessary during regular query execution because the DBMS must return\naccurate results.\nHowever, during training data generation, eliminating this repetition is an opportunity to achieve\nsignificant speedups.\nWhat is needed is a way to determine when and why the DBMS should execute a query again so that\nit can execute fewer queries during training data generation.\nFor the purpose of obtaining training data for its ML models,\nit should skip all queries that do not contribute valuable training data\n(i.e., exhibit new behavior).\nThe DBMS should only re-execute a query if it produces substantially different telemetry (e.g.,\nrun-time) from its past parameterizations.\nOperator Repetition\n\nAcross all queries, the DBMS only uses a small number of operators.\nIf a query is slow, skip the expensive operators – they already appear elsewhere.\n\n\nFor every unskipped query that the DBMS must execute, there remain opportunities to identify\nand eliminate redundancies in its query plan.\nRecall that a query plan is composed of a DBMS’s operators.\nHowever, because a typical DBMS has only a few dozen to a hundred operators, the repetition in\nobserving a particular operator’s behavior is even more frequent than that of entire queries in\nTable 1.\nEliminating this repetition is especially important when the DBMS is exploring new configurations\nthat turn out to be bad, causing queries to take a long time to complete.\nFor example, a query that runs slowly because of missing indexes will remain slow for the rest of\nits execution.\nYet the importance of that particular query to the training data corpus\nis minimal because it spends most of its time performing disk reads in its highly predictable\nsequential scan operators.\nHence, it is essential to reduce the time the DBMS spends executing operators after they\nhave become predictable.\nThe reason this is possible is that operators are independent of each other; a DBMS operator’s\nbehavior depends only on its input tuple(s).\nExisting research relies on this independence to build ML models for the DBMS.\nOur key insight is that integrating such modeling assumptions earlier into the training data\ngeneration process enables early termination in query execution.\nAside: The Need for Models\nExploiting repetition allows us to obtain cheap training data for the DBMS’s models,\nbut such techniques may not be suitable for replacing the models themselves\n(e.g., directly running accelerated queries during database tuning).\nWe aim to build bootstrap models, which are fast and cheap but not necessarily as precise.\nThese models allow the DBMS to begin its tuning loop.\nHowever, as that happens, the DBMS can spend more compute to build more complex models (e.g.,\nhierarchical models) on the same training data.\nThe higher precision of these complex models can improve the quality of its tuning recommendations.\nAdditionally, most models only require query plans as an input.\nThey do not require the DBMS to be running on the same machine.\nThis allows the DBMS to deploy and parallelize its tuning algorithms across different machines\n(e.g., with GPUs for faster inference) without paying the high cost of provisioning separate copies\nof the DBMS’s hardware and data.\nBecause keeping modeling as a separate step in the tuning pipeline confers various benefits,\nwe limit our scope to collecting training training data faster.\nSolution\nTo summarize the discussion above:\n\nThe DBMS generates training data by executing queries.\nExecuting queries is a bottleneck for ML-based DBMS automation.\nBecause training data does not need to compute exact query results, the DBMS can skip or\naccelerate query execution by exploiting repetition to synthesize training data.\n\nArchitecture\nGiven this, we present the Boot framework to accelerate training data generation.\nBoot is transparent to the DBMS’s upstream ML components and leverages workload repetition in two\nways to expedite training data collection while minimizing its impact on the accuracy of the ML\nmodels.\nFirst, Boot reduces the number of queries the DBMS executes by recognizing redundant queries\nbased on their high-level semantics, avoiding re-execution through reusing previously computed\ntraining data (macro-acceleration).\nNext, for the queries that the DBMS does execute, Boot modifies their run-time execution behavior\nby injecting special operators into their query plans.\nThese operators (1) dynamically identify redundant computations and then (2) intelligently\nshort-circuit parts of the plan to expedite their completion (micro-acceleration).\n\n\nFigure 1, Architecture:\n\nAn overview of Boot's internal modules and execution flow.\nThe Macro-Accelerator (MA) decides whether to execute a query, and the\nMicro-Accelerator (µA) accelerates the execution of a specific query.\n\n\nAs Fig 1 shows, Boot integrates into a DBMS using two modules:\n\nThe Macro-Accelerator (MA) sits between the DBMS’s network handler and planner,\nThe Micro-Accelerator (µA) embeds itself in the DBMS’s execution engine.\n\nBoot’s design does not modify the DBMS’s interface for training data generation.\nClients still connect to a Boot-enhanced DBMS over standard APIs (e.g., JDBC, ODBC) to execute\ntheir workloads and collect training data.\nThis compatibility allows Boot to drop into existing modeling pipelines without any code change;\nthe only effect is that the DBMS produces training data faster.\nHowever, because Boot alters the DBMS’s regular query execution semantics, it is\nfundamentally unsuitable\nfor production environments.\nTherefore, we deploy Boot on an offline clone of the production DBMS to avoid application errors.\n\n\nListing 1:\nTPC-H Q9.\n\nWe now provide an overview of Boot’s macro- and micro-accelerators using the TPC-H Q9 query shown\nin Listing 1 as a running example. Executing 1000 iterations of Q9\n(with different strings substituted for %COLOR%) at scale-factor (SF) 100 on\nPostgreSQL (v15) takes 17 hours. Enabling Boot reduces the time required to 1 minute with minor\ndegradation in ML model accuracy. We omit technical details for brevity and present only the\nhigh-level intuition in this blog post; we encourage interested readers to check out our paper.\nMacro-Accelerator\nBoot’s Macro-Accelerator (MA) module inspects each query request as it arrives to determine whether\nit should be executed again (i.e., whether executing it would increase the diversity of the\ntraining data gathered thus far).\n\nMacro-Accelerator = (1) Similarity + (2) Adaptivity\n(1) Fingerprinting identifies similar queries\n(2) Exponential skipping decides whether to re-execute queries\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that 1 when a SQL query arrives,\nthe MA fingerprints it and checks whether it has executed the query before.\nThis fingerprint is computed on raw SQL strings because the MA is placed before query planning\nto avoid the overhead of planning unnecessary queries.\nA simple example of a fingerprint is for the MA to remove the SQL string’s constants, producing a\nquery template.\nIn the Q9 example above, the MA replaces the ‘%[COLOR]%’ in the string with a placeholder.\nMore complex schemes for fingerprinting may incorporate a query’s parametric behavior or the DBMS’s\ncurrent configuration to increase the quality of the training data, which we elaborate on in the\npaper.\nNext, 2 the MA looks up the query’s fingerprint in its result cache to\ndetermine whether the DBMS recently executed a similar query.\nThis cache maps each fingerprint to a record containing (1) the query’s output and (2) the\ntelemetry produced by the DBMS while executing the query.\nThe former is necessary because existing workload replay and benchmarking tools assume the\nDBMS returns query results with a particular schema (e.g., JSON-formatted plans).\nAfter performing the lookup,\n\nIf the cache does not contain a matching fingerprint, the Boot framework forwards the request\nfor the DBMS’s processing as usual.\nHowever, if the MA’s cache contains a match, it then decides whether to skip the query.\n\nTo skip the query, it returns the cached result and records that it skipped.\nTo execute the query, it again forwards the request to the DBMS for processing.\n\n\n\nWe now sketch a brief overview of the MA’s policies for skipping query re-execution, leaving\nthe technical details to our paper.\nThe high-level idea is similar to exponential backoff, which we now describe as exponential\nskipping.\nEach time the DBMS executes a query, the MA analyzes its resulting telemetry to see whether the\nrun-time falls within two standard deviations of the fingerprint’s historical mean.\n\nIf so, the latest query instance is considered similar. The MA exponentially increases the\nnumber of times to skip this fingerprint until the subsequent execution.\nOtherwise, the skipping algorithm resets. The MA clears the corresponding cache entry.\n\nFor example, suppose that Q9 always takes a median run-time of 65 seconds and that the MA skips\nqueries up to a threshold of 100 times.\nThe number of times that the MA skips Q9 in between executions is given by the sequence\n[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 100, ... ], dropping the time required for 1000 executions of Q9\nfrom 17 hours to 16 minutes.\nHowever, should a Q9 invocation exhibit new behavior, the skipping sequence is reset to sample\nfuture instances more frequently.\nThe choice of run-time as a metric is an optimization to avoid storing and comparing against all\nexecuted plans, allowing the MA to maintain only approximately 10 KB of state\n(e.g., run-time, number of input rows per operator)\nper query template.\nAs Table 1 shows, a workload typically contains up to a few thousand query templates, so the total\nstorage overhead of MA is only in the tens of MBs.\nMicro-Accelerator\n\nMicro-Accelerator = (1) Modifying Tuple Flows + (2) Sampling + (3) Scaling\n(1) When the flow of tuples stabilizes, the operator is predictable\n(2) An operator’s output induces more work, so sample to control the work generated\n(3) When stopping an operator early, scale up its telemetry to prevent underestimation\n\n\nEach query that the MA module does not skip then goes to the DBMS’s query planner.\nThe Boot’s Micro-Accelerator (µA) injects its special operators into the query plan at this stage.\nThese injected components wrap a plan’s operators for the µA to monitor their run-time execution\nconstantly.\nWhen the µA detects that an operator’s behavior has stabilized (i.e., more training data\nfrom that operator is unnecessary), it sends a message to the corresponding wrapper to alter\nthe operator’s tuple processing behavior (e.g., reduce the amount of output produced).\nThe core idea that the µA’s injection exploits is that the DBMS performs query processing at the\ngranularity of its operators.\nFor example, the\nVolcano model\nrequires every operator to implement a Next() function that returns its next tuple.\nTherefore, to support µA’s injection, the DBMS only needs to provide a way to wrap the tuple\nproduction function (e.g., by replacing an operator’s Next() function pointer), either at a\nsource-code level or through\nextensibility hooks.\nBecause most DBMSs have existing code paths that provide such functionality for\ninstrumentation,\nimplementing µA’s injection is relatively straightforward.\nFigure 1 shows that 3 the µA encapsulates each of the DBMS’s physical\nplan operators (e.g., scans, joins) with a special wrapper operator to control its run-time\nbehavior dynamically.\nFor example, this wrapper can sample the wrapped operator’s output to emit only 10% of the tuples\nthat it would otherwise produce.\nIt can also terminate an operator’s execution early when the µA detects it should do so,\nstopping the operator from creating additional work.\nSince µA may short-circuit an operator’s execution, 4 Boot scales each\noperator’s telemetry to approximate the telemetry of its full execution.\nFor example, a scan operator that processes only 10% of its expected rows may have its measured\ntimings scaled ten-fold.\nThis scaling improves ML model accuracy as it guards against underpredicting query execution times.\nThe key advantage of µA’s wrapper-based approach that directly modifies a physical query plan is\nthat the DBMS is guaranteed to generate the same plan with and without Boot enabled.\nSome DBMSs alter the query plan when using other sampling techniques (e.g., SQL-level\nTABLESAMPLE), producing plans that differ in shape and performance characteristics.\nBecause the DBMS is collecting training data to build models of its behavior, the training plans\nmust resemble an actual deployment’s plans as much as possible.\nLastly, after the DBMS executes the µA-wrapped plan, it forwards the query result and telemetry to\nthe MA module.\nThe MA module stores this information in its result cache for future invocations of similar\nqueries.\nBoot’s MA and µA modules are independent: if either component is disabled, the DBMS will\nprocess data with its regular non-accelerated components instead.\nHowever, they enhance each other’s ability to accelerate workload execution.\nIn the paper, we show that the combined effect of both accelerators obtains up to 225x speedup.\nResults\nWe highlight a few key results on a “standard” benchmarking setup for PostgreSQL (v15), that is:\n\nBenchmark 1: TPC-H, scale factor 100\n\nRepresents a workload with uniform data distribution.\n\n\nBenchmark 2: DSB, scale factor 10\n\nRepresents a workload with complex data distributions, join patterns, and skew.\n\n\nModeling technique: AutoGluon\n\nAutoGluon automatically searches over hyperparameters and techniques (e.g., gradient-boosted\ntrees, random forests, linear models, neural networks) that existing work uses to build models.\nWe found that AutoGluon is competitive with (and often outperforms) hand-crafted models from\nprior work.\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, we compare four configurations:\n\nthe default DBMS without Boot enabled (Original),\nthe DBMS with only Boot’s macro-accelerator active (MA),\nthe DBMS with only Boot’s micro-accelerator active (µA),\nthe DBMS with both of Boot’s accelerators active (Combined).\n\nThe full paper contains other scenarios, sensitivity analyses, and comparisons to different\ntechniques.\nCollection Time\n\nBoot achieves up to 225x speedup on the examples in this blog post.\nThe general scale of its improvement is improving collection time from weeks to days.\n\n\nWe first measure the collection time as previously defined; that is, the time the DBMS\ntakes to generate training data by executing the workload.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  Figure 2a: TPC-H\n  Figure 2b: DSB\n\n\n  \n    Figure 2, Collection Time:\n    \n    The time to generate training data with different modules of Boot active (lower is better).\n    \n  \n\n\nFigure 2 shows the following:\n\nMA obtains speedups of 2.26x on TPC-H and 3.14x on DSB.\nµA obtains speedups of 2.22x on TPC-H and 23.2x on DSB.\nCombined obtains speedups of 6.64x on TPC-H and 225x on DSB.\n\nWe describe a broader range of speedups across different scale factors in the paper, with Boot\ngenerally performing better as the dataset size grows.\nThe takeaway is that Boot reduces collection time from weeks to days, or from days to hours.\nThis acceleration is significant because it allows an autonomous DBMS to obtain its ML models in a\nfraction of the time, minimizing the time it spends without autonomous capabilities.\nWe also observe from Figure 2 that:\n\nThe MA and µA obtain different speedups depending on the workload’s complexity and skew.\nWe analyze speedup sources in the paper and only provide a summary here.\n\nThe MA executes exponentially fewer queries.\nOn a histogram of query runtimes, enabling the MA maintains the overall shape but decreases\neach bar’s height significantly (i.e., fewer query invocations) because of exponential\nskipping.\nThe µA executes the same number of queries but accelerates individual queries by reducing the\ntime spent in individual operators.\nA bar chart of individual operator timings shows that the µA achieves up to 209x speedup on\nphysical operators such as index scans, sequential scans, and hash joins.\nThese speedups are from reducing the number of expensive disk operations and tuples processed.\n\n\nThe MA and µA achieve higher speedups together than they do individually.\n\nIn the paper, we show that this effect is most pronounced on queries that are long-running or\nhave instances which time out.\n\n\n\nAbsolute Error\n\nBoot results in models with comparable mean absolute error.\nTuning methods are surprisingly robust to high errors.\n\n\nWe next evaluate the absolute error; that is, the absolute difference between a query’s actual\nlatency and the corresponding model’s predicted latency. We also measure the mean absolute error\n(MAE). We visualize the absolute error across all predictions as a boxplot.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  Figure 3a: TPC-H\n  Figure 3b: DSB\n\n\n  \n    Figure 3, Absolute Error:\n    \n    The absolute error of models that are trained on the individual datasets (lower is better).\n    The red circle shows sample mean and the whiskers extend to 1.5 interquartile range.\n    \n  \n\n\nFigure 3 shows that compared to the MAE of the Original configuration’s models:\n\nMA’s MAE is 2.64x on TPC-H and 1.06x on DSB.\nµA’s MAE is 11.0x on TPC-H and 0.999x on DSB.\nCombined’s MAE is 11.5x on TPC-H and 1.11x on DSB.\n\nIntuitively, these results make sense.\n\nThe MA introduces less error because it produces telemetry under similar conditions.\nIt only decides whether to execute a query and does not modify query execution itself.\nThe µA results in more error because it (1) terminates execution early and (2) scales the\ntelemetry.\nThe Combined configuration generally has the worst of both errors.\n\nTo contextualize these results, we present a scenario from the paper in which we summed the\nprediction error for all invocations of TPC-H’s Q1.\n\nInvoking Q1 for 1000 iterations took 3.7 hours.\nThe Original models are off by 308 seconds (5 minutes), whereas the Combined models are off by\n2099 seconds (35 minutes).\n\nThe Combined models have a 7x more error. However, they only required four days of\ntraining data generation, whereas the Original models required three weeks.\nThe final prediction of the Combined models, 3.1 hours when the actual time was 3.7 hours,\nremains accurate enough to be useful.\n\n\n\nAt this stage, a natural question is how bad the errors can get before the models are no\nlonger usable.\nRecent work\nshows that even models with terrible errors (e.g., 10x, 50x) have comparable\nF1 scores for the task of index recommendation.\nWe started our investigation into this line of research after making similar observations in\ninternal experiments; intuitively, for many tuning tasks, all that matters is getting the\n“direction” of tuning right.\nConclusion\nResearchers have developed effective ML models for database tuning, but integrating these models\ninto an end-to-end tuning loop is challenging because their construction requires an expensive and\nlengthy training data generation process.\nWe introduce two acceleration techniques to expedite training data collection by leveraging the\nunique characteristics of the training data environment; unlike regular query execution, there is\nno need for the DBMS to compute accurate results.\nWe integrate these techniques into our framework Boot that drops into existing modeling pipelines.\nBoot’s sharp reduction in training data collection time makes it well-suited for bootstrapping an\nautonomous DBMS’s initial models, minimizing the time spent without self-tuning capabilities.\nOur paper is under submission.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/boot/","title":"Boot: accelerating training data generation for self-driving database management systems"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/cardinality-constraints/":{"body":"\n\n\nAutomated reasoning (AR) is a branch of artificial intelligence that applies various reasoning techniques to solve problems from mathematics and logic.\nAR engines use clever optimizations and heuristics to solve typically intractable (e.g., NP-hard) problems.\nBefore a problem can be solved with an AR engine it must first be encoded as a list of constraints in some standardized input format.\nThe choice of encoding can significantly impact an AR engine’s performance.\nFor example, with some combinatorial principles choosing a good encoding will enable an AR engine to find a solution in a matter of seconds, but choosing a bad encoding will inhibit the AR engine’s heuristics costing thousands of seconds of search before a solution is found.\nIn this post we will describe techniques for improving encodings for problems represented in Boolean (propositional) logic, giving some guidance for developing encodings that lead to faster solving times.\nWe have all practiced encoding problems at various levels of math.\nTake for example this simple word problem:\n\nExample 1.\n$$$$\n“Find an odd and an even integer that sum to 9.”\n$$$$\nAn initial encoding might include the three constraints:\n\n\\(x + y = 9\\)\n\\(x\\) is even\n\\(y\\) is odd\n\nWe can take this a step further. If \\(x\\) is even then \\(x = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and if \\(y\\) is odd then \\(y = 2\\ell + 1\\) for some integer \\(\\ell\\), giving the new equation:\n\n\\(2k + (2\\ell+1) = 9\\)\n\nNow the problem is in a machine-understandable format, and we can send the linear equation to an AR engine which will produce some solution, e.g., \\(k = 2\\), \\(\\ell = 2\\) meaning \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 5\\).\n\n&nbsp;\nWe often think about and describe problems at a high-level, with abstract constraints (e.g., “\\(x\\) is even”). Encoding is the process of transforming a problem description into a specific format with variables, values, and operators (e.g., + and =), sometimes introducing new variables (e.g., \\(k\\) and \\(\\ell\\)) to simplify the problem.\nIn practice, AR engines consistently solve problems across various domains including planning, cloud security, and software and hardware verification.\nThese problems may contain thousands of variables and millions of constraints.\n\nFigure 1. Solving a problem using automated reasoning.\nThe workflow for solving a problem with AR is shown in Figure 1.\nOver the past two decades the performance of AR engines on diverse sets of problems has significantly improved (Biere et. al. 2023).\nMuch of this progress is due to the development of inprocessing techniques: rules for transforming problems during solving.\nOne of the most effective inprocessing techniques adds new variables that summarize parts of the problem to improve the AR engine’s reasoning capabilities (Haberlandt et. al. 2023).\nIn our work, we study the importance of new variables but shift the focus from the AR engine (inprocessing) to the encoding.\nSpecifically, we look at encodings for one of the most commonly occurring types of high-level constraints: cardinality constraints.\nWe develop techniques that reorder variables within cardinality constraint encodings, finding these new encodings often improve the AR engine’s performance such that it solves problems faster.\nIn this post, we use the game of Sudoku to (1) illustrate the basics of encodings in AR and specifically Boolean satisfiability, (2) describe two simple cardinality constraint encodings, and (3) show the importance of variable orderings in these encodings. We conclude with some experimental results showing the impact of our techniques.\nRepresenting Problems in Automated Reasoning\nThere is a general way to characterize the sorts of problems applicable to AR via constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).\nEach problem has three components:\n\nA set of variables.\nA set of possible values for each variable.\nA set of constraints that must not be violated by a solution.\n\nThe goal of solving a CSP is to find an assignment of values to variables (a.k.a. a solution) that does not violate any of the constraints; or, to report that every possible assignment violates some constraint, meaning no solution exists.\n\nFigure 2. Example Sudoku puzzle.\nConsider the game of Sudoku shown in Figure 2. (Note, the example in Figure 2 has fewer given values than a typical Sudoku puzzle for the purpose of simplifying its presentation.)\nWe might define the problem as:\n\nA variable for each cell in the 9 x 9 grid.\nEach variable can have a value from 1 to 9, and some variables’ values are given.\nNo row, column, or inner 3 x 3 square may have a repeated value.\n\nNow that we have written down the general components of the problem, to finish the encoding we must decide on a specific format.\nDifferent AR engines have different input formats, and these formats determine how the problem is represented and what reasoning techniques the AR engine can use.\nIn Example 1, variables had integer values, and the constraints included the sum and multiplication operators with equivalence (=).\nThere exist AR engines called satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, that will solve problems in this format.\nHowever, many problems are best solved by another sort of AR engine, Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers.\nBoolean Logic\nThe input format for SAT solvers is a formula (set of constraints) in Boolean (propositional) logic, restricting variables to the values true (1) and false (0).\nA variable \\(x\\) can occur in a constraint as a positive literal (\\(x\\)) or a negative literal (\\(\\neg x\\)), where \\(\\neg x\\) is true (1) if \\(x\\) is false, and false (0) if \\(x\\) is true.\nEach constraint is a set of literals, and the constraint is satisfied, i.e., not violated, if at least one of the literals is true. This type of constraint is often referred to as a clause.\nThe cardinality constraint \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n \\geq k \\) is satisfied when the sum of literals is greater than or equal to the bound \\(k\\). We can think of clauses as a special type of cardinality constraint with comparator \\(\\geq\\) and bound 1, stating at least one of the literals is true. For example, the clause \\(x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor \\dots \\lor x_n \\) can be thought of as the cardinality constraint \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n \\geq 1 \\).\nSo, given a problem as a set of cardinality constraints with arbitrary bounds, the cardinality constraints would need to be encoded into clauses before passing the problem to a SAT solver. We show an example of this in the following section, but first present some simple formulas with clauses.\n\nExample 2.\n$$ x + y + z \\geq 1$$\n$$ \\neg x + \\neg z \\geq 1$$\nA solution for the set of clauses above is \\(x=1,y=0,z=0\\).\n\n\nExample 3.\n$$ x + \\neg z \\geq 1$$\n$$ \\neg x + \\neg z \\geq 1$$\n$$ z \\geq 1$$\nThere is no possible solution for the set of clauses above. To satisfy the third clause we must set \\(z = 1\\), then to satisfy the second clause we must set \\(x = 0\\), and these values violate the first clause.\n\n&nbsp;\nReturning to Sudoku, we must apply another layer of encoding to transform the problem into a formula in Boolean logic. The variables cannot have values from 1 to 9 but instead may only be true or false. We will address this by examining the specific cell \\(x\\) in the top left corner of the puzzle from Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Example Sudoku puzzle with the variable \\(x\\).\nTo represent the possible values (1-9) of \\(x\\), we will introduce 9 variables \\( x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_9\\), where \\( x_i = 1\\) if \\(x\\) has value \\(i\\) and \\( x_i = 0\\) if \\(x\\) does not have value \\(i\\).\nFor example, the red values in Figure 3 cannot be held by \\(x\\) since they are in the same row or column, so \\( x_7 = x_8 = x_9 = 0\\).\nWe will add a clause stating that at least one of the \\(x_i\\) variables is true, meaning \\(x\\) has at least one value:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_9 \\geq 1$$\nNext, we need to ensure it is not possible that two \\(x_i\\) variables are true at the same time, e.g., \\( x_4 = x_5 = 1\\), because \\(x\\) cannot have two values simultaneously.\nThis requires the introduction of another constraint, an at-most-one (AMO) constraint:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_9 \\leq 1$$\nRemember, Boolean variables can be either true (1) or false (0), so this constraint says that at most one of the variables \\( x_i\\) are true; in other words, \\(x\\) cannot have two values simultaneously. Unfortunately, this AMO constraint is not a clause. We could switch the comparator, obtaining \\(\\neg x_1 + \\neg x_2 + \\dots + \\neg x_9 \\geq 8\\) but a clause requires the bound to be 1. So, we must go one step further and encode the AMO constraint into clauses.\nEncoding Cardinality Constraints\nThere are multiple ways to encode an AMO constraint into clauses.\nThe simplest approach, sometimes called the naive or pairwise encoding,\nintroduces clauses that say no pair of variables are true at the same time, e.g., \\(\\neg x_1 + \\neg x_2 \\geq 1\\), for all pairs.\nWe can visualize the pairwise encoding as a connected graph, where each edge represents a clause between two variables saying they cannot both be true at once.\n\nFigure 4. Graph-based visualization of the pairwise AMO encoding of $$ x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_9 \\leq 1$$\nIt is often the case that smaller encodings, measured by the number of clauses introduced, are better for solver performance (Asín et al. 2011).\nOne way to reduce the size of an encoding is with the addition of new variables (a.k.a. encoding variables) that divide the constraint into subproblems.\nWe show an example of this using an instance of the commander encoding (Klieber and Kwon 2007) with three encoding variables \\(y_1,y_2,y_3\\):\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \\neg y_1 \\leq 1$$\n$$ x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + \\neg y_2 \\leq 1$$\n$$ x_7 + x_8 + x_9 + \\neg y_3 \\leq 1$$\n$$ y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \\leq 1$$\nIn the encoding above, the encoding variables \\(y_1,y_2,y_3\\) split the original AMO constraint into three parts. Referring to the puzzle in Figure 3., if \\(x\\) has a value between 1 and 3, then \\(y_1\\) must be set to true. So, \\(y_1\\) summarizes the first third of the original AMO constraint.\nLikewise, if \\(x\\) has a value between 4 and 6, then \\(y_2\\) must be set to true, and similarly for \\(y_3\\).\nFinaly, we need the constraint stating at most one of \\(y_i\\) can be true.\nIntuitively, at most one group (\\(y_i\\)) may be selected, and from that group at most one (\\(x_i\\)) value may be selected.\nIn general, the original cardinality constraint can be divided into arbitrarily sized groupings,\nbut groupings of 3 are often used in practice to minimize both the number of encoding variables and number of clauses. By encoding one large AMO constraint as 4 smaller AMO constraints, the number of edges (clauses in the encoding) drops from 36 to 21.\n\nFigure 5. Graph-based visualization of the commander AMO encoding of $$ x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_9 \\leq 1$$ using 3 encoding variables \\(y_1,y_2,y_3\\).\nThe benefits of smaller encodings are well-known. For example, encoding AMO constraints using smaller encodings can improve solving time significantly on unsatisfiable formulas (Reeves, Heule, and Bryant 2024).\nHowever, there is more to a good encoding than its size.\nIn recent work we explored an alternative way to improve encodings by reordering variables within the constraint and therefore modifying the meaning of encoding variables without changing the size of the encoding.\nThe Impact of Variable Ordering in Cardinality Constraints\nThere are many types of encodings for cardinality constraints, and they often introduce encoding variables that divide the cardinality constraint hierarchically into subproblems. One of the most  used cardinality constraint encodings is the totalizer (Bailleux and Boufkhad 2003), forming a tree-like structure with encoding variables at the internal nodes and problem variables (variables from the original constraint, e.g., \\(x_i\\)’s) at the leaves. At a high level, the encoding variables in the totalizer group problem variables together similar to the commander encoding from Figure 5. By changing the ordering of variables in the cardinality constraint we can change the groupings of variables in the encoding, thereby changing the meaning of encoding variables without affecting the overall meaning of the encoding or its size. Take for example a reordering of the AMO constraint on 9 variables:\n$$ x_1 + x_3 + x_5 + x_2 + x_4 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + x_9 \\leq 1$$\nThe visualization for encoding this cardinality constraint is shown in Figure 6. Note, this graph looks almost the same as in Figure 5 except the problem variables (\\(x_i\\)’s) have been reordered. This will result in the same encoding structure with respect to the number of clauses and encoding variables, with a permutation of variables within the clauses. With the reordering, \\(y_1\\) now summarizes \\(x_1,x_3,x_5\\) instead of \\(x_1,x_2,x_3\\). We will show how this small change can impact a solver’s reasoning capabilities in an example below.\n\nFigure 6. Graph-based visualization of the AMO encoding on $$ x_1 + x_3 + x_5 + x_2 + x_4 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + x_9 \\leq 1$$ using 3 encoding variables \\(y_1,y_2,y_3\\). Note, the difference from Figure 5 arises from a different ordering of the \\(x^i\\) variables in the cardinality constraint, yielding a different labelling of the nodes.\n\nFigure 7. Example Sudoku puzzle with three additional variables \\(p,m,n\\).\nFirst, \\(x\\) cannot have the value 7,8, or 9, so \\( x_7 = x_8 = x_9 = 0\\), simplifying the AMO constraint for \\(x\\) to:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \\neg y_1 \\leq 1$$\n$$ x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + \\neg y_2 \\leq 1$$\n$$ y_1 + y_2 \\leq 1$$\nLooking at the puzzle in Figure 7, the variables \\(n,m,p\\) each can only have a value from the set 1,3, or 5. This is confirmed by examining the puzzle and considering the rows, columns, and squares for each of \\(n,m,p\\). Since \\(n,m,p\\) are all conflicting with \\(x\\) and each other, it must be true that \\(x\\) cannot have a value 1, 3, or 5, and must instead be either 2, 4, or 6. This fact is not easily learned with the given encoding for \\(x\\).\nLet’s consider the way \\(x_i\\) variables are grouped in the first two constraints of our encoding. Instead of the original grouping, we can use the grouping from Figure 7 and get:\n$$ x_1 + x_3 + x_5 + \\neg y_1 \\leq 1$$\n$$ x_2 + x_4 + x_6 + \\neg y_2 \\leq 1$$\n$$ y_1 + y_2 \\leq 1$$\nThe overall meaning is still the same, \\(x\\) can only have one value; but the meaning of the encoding variables has changed. Now, \\(y_1\\) is true when \\(x\\) has value 1,3, or 5; and \\(y_2\\) is true when \\(x\\) has value 2,4, or 6.\n\nLet’s first assume the puzzle is fully encoded in Boolean logic, meaning that each of \\(n,m,p\\) have corresponding variables and constraints. Second, let’s assume that a solver can propagate known values, for example, the solver can propagate \\(n \\neq 9\\) since 9 is the same row as \\(n\\). With this new grouping of problem variables, a solver can carry out the following reasoning:\n\nAssume \\(y_1\\) from our second encoding is true.\n\nThis makes \\(y_2\\) false, so \\(x\\) has a value 1,3, or 5.\nThe four variables \\(n,m,p\\) and \\(x\\) are on the same row and so all must have different values.\nWe have three possible values 1,3, and 5 to assign to the four variables \\(n,m,p\\) and \\(x\\).\nThe solver reasons that this leads to a conflict, since each variable must have a unique value.\n\nTherefore, \\(y_1\\) must be false. This forces \\(y_2\\) to true since it is the only remaining encoding variable for \\(x\\), reducing the possible values of \\(x\\) to 2,4, or 6.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy regrouping the problem variables (\\(x_i\\)) in the constraints and therefore changing the meanings of the encoding variables (\\(y_i\\)), we are able to learn additional facts about the puzzle.\nThis sort of reasoning can be used by a SAT solver to more quickly prune the search space and find a solution.\nImportantly, such facts cannot be learned quickly with the first encoding because the meanings of the encoding variables are less useful.\nAn Experimental Evaluation\nSudoku is simple and easy to understand, making it a good example for explaining the impact of variable orderings in cardinality constraint encodings.\nHowever, Sudoku puzzles are typically easy to solve and therefore not suitable for an experimental evaluation.\nInstead, we used more challenging problems from the 2023 Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) competition.\nThe annual SAT and MaxSAT competitions collect problems spanning a wide range of domains, coming from both academic and industrial sources, meant to test the limits of modern solvers.\nA MaxSAT problem can be transformed into a SAT formula containing a set of clauses and one (often large) cardinality constraint.\nIn our experimental evaluation, we considered three options for ordering variables in the cardinality constraints:\n\nNatural: use the ordering provided in the original problem encoding.\nRandom5: use five random orderings and select the one that yields the best solver runtime.\nProximity: use an algorithm that creates an ordering based on the proximity of variables within the problem’s clauses.\n\nAfter the variables were ordered, we encoded the cardinality constraints into clauses using the totalizer encoding from the Python package PySAT, then solved the problem using the SAT solver CaDiCaL. Each problem was solved independently with an 1800 second timeout. The results are presented in Figure 8. The plot shows the number of problems solved (y-axis) by each configuration within a given time limit (x-axis), and each tick is a new instance solved. For example, if we used the Random5 ordering and attempted to solve each problem with its own 600 second timeout, we would solve 550 of the problems. Further, with a 400 second timeout for each problem, both Proximity and Natural solve around 600 problems.\nIn short, the proximity approach tries to group variables that appear in constraints together.\nThe intuition is that if variables appear in a subset of the constraints together; by grouping them we give the solver the ability to reason locally about that subset via encoding variables.\nThe proximity ordering takes some time to compute, which is why it does not catch up to the natural ordering until about 400 seconds. But by the 1800 second timeout the proximity configuration solves the most formulas. So, even if it takes some additional preprocessing time to find a good ordering, it will pay off in the end.\nFurther, Random5 performed much worse than the other two approaches, showing that a bad ordering can seriously harm the solver’s capabilities. In practice, if users are not careful with their variable orderings, they may unintentionally encode problems that are much harder to solve.\n\nFigure 8. The number of solved formulas over time for the three variable ordering configurations.\nThis research was performed in collaboration with Mindy Hsu, João Filipe Boucinha de Sá, Ruben Martins, and Marijn Heule, appearing in AAAI 25 under the title “The Impact of Literal Sorting on Cardinality Constraint Encodings”.\nLooking Forward\nThe crucial first step of solving any problem with automated reasoning is the choice of encoding.\nIn this post we explored the importance of a good cardinality constraint encoding and found that by simply reordering variables we can manipulate the meaning of encoding variables to improve solver performance.\nWe can extend this study of cardinality constraints by considering ways to manipulate the meaning of encoding variables during solving (within the AR engine).\nAdditionally, there are many types of encodings for various high-level constraints that appear across problem domains in AR.\nWe can begin to move away from the long-held belief that smaller encodings are always better and focus instead on the meaning of new variables introduced in the encodings.\nFor example, taking our strategy for improving cardinality constraint encodings and lifting it to pseudo-Boolean (cardinality with coefficients) encodings might yield similar improvements.\nReferences\nAsín, R., Nieuwenhuis, R., Oliveras, A., and Rodríguez-Carbonell, E. 2011.

On x86-based systems, the supported page sizes are 4KB, 2MB and 1GB.\nThe set of physical addresses that a page is mapped to is identified by a Physical Page Number (PPN).\nThe mappings between virtual and physical addresses are controlled by the operating system (OS) in a manner that is transparent to applications.\nThis abstraction is called virtual memory.\nVirtual memory provides many benefits.\nIt supports the isolation of applications’ memory, meaning that an application can only access memory that is assigned to it by the OS.\nTherefore, an application cannot access memory owned by another application by default.\nVirtual memory also supports the protection of memory so that only allowed modes of access (a combination of read, write and execute) to an application’s memory is allowed.\nFurthermore, virtual memory introduces flexibility into memory management.\nFor example, multiple applications can coexist on a system without prior coordination on which part of the memory each can use, because each application has a dedicated view of memory.\nThe Worsening Virtual Memory Bottleneck\nThe virtual memory abstraction is not free.\nEvery time a virtual address is translated into a physical address, page tables (the data structures set up by the OS to map the addresses) must be accessed, creating an overhead.\nTo mitigate the overhead, the hardware contains a cache for the frequently used mappings between virtual and physical addresses in page tables, called the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).\nUnfortunately, the unabating growth of applications’ memory needs\nmeans that more mappings in page tables are needed, making the TLB less effective and creating a virtual memory bottleneck.\nIn reality, memory capacity has increased dramatically over the past few decades, increasing from dozens of kilobytes to terabytes, but the TLB is size-constrained due to limitations of hardware cache scaling.\nAs a result, the percentage of mappings that can be cached in the TLB versus the total number of mappings needed for a large memory footprint of an application, called TLB coverage, keeps dropping.\nThis drop in TLB coverage results in excessive virtual memory overhead for memory-intensive applications.\nCase in point, as shown in the figure below, the memory capacity of servers at Meta (shown by the blue line and the left y axis in the figure) has increased by almost eight times over five hardware generations (x axis). However, the size of the TLB remains stagnant, leading to minuscule and shrinking TLB coverage (the orange lines and the right y axis).\nGoogle’s profiling further revealed that approximately\n20% of CPU cycles in their datacenters are stalled on TLB misses [1].\n\nUnfortunately, this problem is only bound to get worse due to: (i) the inherent hardware limits of TLB size scaling, (ii) terabyte-scale memory capacity through technologies like Compute Express Link (CXL), and (iii) the increase of memory-intensive applications such as those for graph processing, caching and scientific computing.\nSolutions Rely on Memory Contiguity\nExisting solutions to reduce the overhead of virtual memory rely on memory contiguity: i.e., ranges of memory that are either free or in-use by a single application.\nThese solutions consider a contiguous range of memory as a single unit, therefore, reduces the size of TLB  needed to cache the mappings of a given amount of memory.\nIn addition, some solutions map an entire application’s dataset using memory contiguity [2], and some others use alternative virtual memory designs that require less memory contiguity for good performance [3, 4, 5].\nMemory Contiguity is Scarce in Datacenters\nMemory contiguity is diminished as a system runs because the time intervals between the allocation and the freeing of ranges of memory vary widely, causing in-use memory to be sandwiched between free memory. This phenomenon is called memory fragmentation.\nThere are many prior works suggesting that memory contiguity is in low supply due to memory fragmentation [6,7].\nTo test whether this is the case, we performed a detailed investigation of memory contiguity at hyperscale across Meta’s datacenters.\nWe sampled servers across the fleet, and we show the memory contiguity distribution in the following figure.\nThe values on the x-axis represent the amount of contiguous free memory of a particular size (2MB, 4MB, 32MB, 1GB) as a percentage of total free memory on a server.\n\nLooking at the x-axis value at 0% (circled in the figure), we see that 23% of servers do not even have physical memory contiguity for a single 2MB huge page.\nWe observe that memory contiguity worsens at 4MB and 32MB, with 60% of servers unable to allocate a single 32MB page.\nWe also find that it is practically impossible to dynamically allocate 1GB pages in production, with over 90% of servers having no such contiguity.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that there is little to no correlation between memory contiguity and server uptime, with the Pearson correlation coefficient between server uptime and the number of free 2MB pages being only 0.00286.\nThe low correlation means that fragmentation affects all servers. In practice, servers can quickly get heavily fragmented within the first hour after boot-up while the mean server uptime is days or weeks—turning memory fragmentation into a major challenge.\nFinally, our study exposes unmovable pages as the root cause for the lack of physical memory contiguity.\nMemory compaction recovers memory contiguity by migrating away in-use pages to create contiguous free areas in physical memory, as illustrated by “Potential Contiguity” in the figure below.\nUnmovable pages, as their name suggests, cannot be moved around to defragment the memory and recover memory contiguity, causing compaction failures. This is illustrated in the figure below: compaction cannot migrate the unmovable pages, failing to create larger memory contiguity.\nIn particular, we identify several sources of unmovable pages, including networking buffers, filesystems, and page tables.\n\nContiguitas Design\nTo address the lack of physical memory contiguity and alleviate the virtual memory overhead, we introduce Contiguitas with the goal of eliminating fragmentation due to unmovable pages.\nTo that end, Contiguitas first redesigns memory management in the OS to confine unmovable pages and completely separate them from movable ones (Step 1), preventing unmovable pages from scattering across the address space. Then, Contiguitas dynamically resizes regions in response to memory pressure (Step 2). Finally, Contiguitas drastically reduces previously unmovable pages through hardware extensions in the last-level cache (LLC) that enable transparent migration of unmovable pages while they are in use (Step 3).\n\nUnmovable Confinement\nThe first design principle of\nContiguitas is to strictly separate unmovable from movable pages using two dedicated regions, the movable and the unmovable regions in the physical address space.\nAllocations are confined in their respective region. Contiguitas categorizes the physical pages based on their addresses and keeps them on distinct free lists for each region. Memory in each region can only be allocated from pages in the free lists belonging to that region. When a page is freed, it is returned back to its respective list. This approach simplifies the critical path of allocations as the OS can quickly pick a free page while avoiding mixing different types of allocations.\nFor allocations that are first allocated as movable but later become unmovable due to memory pinning, Contiguitas migrates them to the unmovable region and marks them as unmovable. This approach avoids the dynamic pollution of the movable region and subsequent compaction failures.\nDynamic Resizing\nThe crucial part in achieving confinement is the sizing of the unmovable region. If it is too big, unused memory in the unmovable region is wasted while there is limited movable memory for the  applications, causing frequent reclaims or even allocation failures. On the other hand, if the unmovable region is too small, unmovable pages may fail to allocate. Therefore, Contiguitas dynamically balances the sizes of the movable and unmovable regions while not negatively affecting application performance. There are three major challenge in dynamic resizing.\nChallenge 1: Moving Resizing Off the Critical Path\nThe first challenge is to move resizing operations off the critical path of memory allocation.\nContiguitas performs resizing off the critical path of memory allocation to avoid latency overheads during allocation. This is accomplished by monitoring the amount of free memory when periodic memory reclaim (i.e. freeing up memory) is triggered by the kernel. Contiguitas extends reclaim to wake up a kernel thread to perform resizing whenever the free memory in either region falls below a low-watermark threshold.\nChallenge 2: Resizing Policies\nThe second challenge is to decide when and how much to resize.\nContiguitas introduces the concept of per-region memory pressure and extends pressure stall information (PSI) [6] to track time wasted due to lack of free memory in the movable and unmovable region separately, which is then used to calculate the expansion/shrinking amount.\nChallenge 3: Making Resizing Possible and Cheap\nThe third challenge is to ease resizing and reduce data movement.\nContiguitas introduces a bias to prefer physical pages further away from the region border.\nSome unmovable pages that are inherently long lived (e.g., kernel code pages) are safely placed by Contiguitas early on at the end of the unmovable region that is farthest from the movable region.\nOn the other hand, pages that are initially in the movable region and later on pinned to memory and migrated to the unmovable region often exhibit short lifetimes.\nIn general, Contiguitas prefers allocating pages away from the region border as long as sufficient free space is available in order to avoid unmovable pages blocking resizing and to reduce the amount of data movement needed for resizing.\nFurthermore, for the unlikely case of unmovable pages blocking the reduction in size of the unmovable region, the hardware migration mechanism of Contiguitas described below can be utilized to move such pages away.\nHardware Migration of Previously Unmovable Pages\nThe second design principle guiding\nContiguitas is to drastically reduce the amount of unmovable pages by turning them into movable ones.\nOur study at Meta’s datacenters revealed that a significant portion of unmovable pages used for input/output (I/O) are impossible to move as access to the page cannot be blocked for a software migration to take place.\nHardware support is required because it is impossible for software to move such pages as it cannot atomically perform both the mapping update in the page table and the page copy operation of the application data. Hence software has to block access to the page for the duration of page migration in order to avoid spurious writes to it. Even if access to the page could be blocked, software page migration induces a long downtime due to (a) TLB invalidations that scale poorly with the number of TLBs that need invalidating, and (b) the page copy.\nTo this end, Contiguitas enables transparent page migration while the page remains in use. Such migrations can substantially reduce the size of the unmovable region and lead to more efficient defragmentation and memory management as the vast majority of pages can be moved on demand. While Contiguitas is motivated by unmovable pages, its design is  suitable for both movable and unmovable pages.\nThe hardware extensions of Contiguitas are located in the LLC as shown in the figure below. Contiguitas targets a multi-core processor with a cache-coherent interconnect. The hardware platform further includes an Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) with local TLBs.\n\nAt a high level, Contiguitas aliases a physical page under migration with a destination page and redirects appropriate traffic to the destination page based on the progress of the migration.\nSpecifically, a page migration is initiated in Step 1 by the OS that provides the source and destination physical page numbers (PPN) to Contiguitas. Contiguitas stores them in a metadata table (part b in the figure) along with a Ptr field that points to the next line to be copied, and enables access redirection.\nFor the next step, Contiguitas starts the page copy. Contiguitas copies a cacheline by bringing it into the LLC (Step 2) and copying it from the source to the destination (Step 3). Finally, it increments Ptr. This process continues until the page is copied and Contiguitas notifies the OS.\nDuring this process, a page may be accessed with either the source or the destination mapping. If a request hits in the private caches (L1 and L2 caches), it is serviced normally as in a regular cache hit. As shown in Step 4, on a miss Contiguitas checks whether a line is currently stored in private caches with the opposite mapping of the request, i.e., if a request is for the source mapping and the line is stored with the destination mapping, and vice versa. If so, it invalidates any cached copy. Otherwise, the request is serviced regularly. This invariant allows the caching of lines under migration as only the source or the destination mapping is active in the private caches.\nUpon the completion of page copying, the OS modifies the page table entry to point to the destination page and starts local TLB invalidations, shown in Step 5. In Contiguitas, TLB invalidations do not require the slow inter-processor interrupts (IPI), as both mappings are concurrently active during the migration. The source page has now been migrated and does not block memory compaction anymore.\nResults: Ample Contiguity in Datacenters\nWe implement the OS component of Contiguitas in Linux and run our experiments in Meta’s production datacenters with four production workloads:  a continuous-integration service (CI), a web server (Web), and two caching services (Cache A and Cache B).\nPotential Memory Contiguity\nTo quantify the impact of Contiguitas on memory contiguity, we compare each workload’s steady state under Linux and Contiguitas.\nSpecifically, we quantify the contiguous regions that can be formed if we run a perfect software compaction in order to service allocation requests of 2MB, 32MB and 1GB pages.\n\nWith Linux we see that some 2MB allocation are possible as there is still some physical memory not polluted by unmovable pages.\nHowever, Linux struggles as we search for larger contiguous regions at 32MB granularity, and fails to find even a single 1GB page.\nOn the other hand, Contiguitas isolates the unmovable region by design and hence the whole movable region can potentially be used after compaction for large contiguous allocations, even 1GB\npages.\nEnd-to-End Performance\nTo measure Contiguitas’ improvements to end-to-end performance due to increased memory contiguity, we use requests per second under certain latency targets based on the characteristics of each workload.\nWe consider two setups: Full Fragmentation (Linux Full) and Partial Fragmentation (Linux Partial).\nFull Fragmentation represents the case where a workload lands on a server whose memory is already fully fragmented without any 2MB memory contiguity. Partial Fragmentation represents the case where a workload lands on a partially fragmented server at random that is representative of the majority of servers at Meta.\n\nContiguitas achieves performance improvements between 2-9% for partially fragmented servers that represent the majority of the servers, and between 7-18% for fully fragmented servers that represent nearly a quarter of Meta’s fleet. Notably, Contiguitas’ contiguity gains enable Web (one of Meta’s largest services) to dynamically allocate 1GB huge pages, leading to a 7.5% performance win (shown as the red bar) that is unattainable with 2MB pages alone.\nHardware Evaluation\nWe use full-system simulations to show that Contiguitas efficiently migrates previously unmovable pages without affecting application performance.\nWe consider two open source applications – Memcached and NGINX – to cover applications that do and do not benefit from huge page availability.\nEven at a rate of 1000 pages migrated per second, which would be unwarranted for a real environment,\nthe page migrations conducted by Contiguitas do not have a negative impact on both applications’ performance compared to the Linux baseline.\nWhen combined with the benefits of contiguity and 2MB huge pages, Memcached performance improves by 7%.\nFurthermore, Contiguitas scales well with the number of TLBs, keeping the page unavailable time during a page migration constant and equal to the time of a local TLB invalidation, whereas under status quo the page unavailable time increases linearly.\nOverall, Contiguitas does not negatively impact applications that do not benefit from contiguity while improving contiguity and performance for those that do.\nConclusion and Impacts\nContiguitas is a holistic solution that addresses the long-standing problem of memory contiguity in datacenters.\nWe evaluated Contiguitas in a production environment at Meta’s datacenters.\nOur results show that Contiguitas successfully confines and reduces unmovable allocations, leading to 2-18% end-to-end performance improvements.\nContiguitas is in the process of being upstreamed to the Linux kernel [7], and Meta is actively working on deploying it in production.\nReferences\n[1] A.

Following that, I will present a tight lower bound for the directed cut sparsifier of a balanced directed graph, which is unknown in the previous literature. This blog post is based on joint work with Yu Cheng and David P. Woodruff, and an extended version of this research has been accepted for publication at PODS 2024.\nIntroduction\nWhat is a (for-all) cut sparsifer?\nThe notion of cut sparsifiers has been extremely influential. It was introduced by Benczúr and Karger [Benczúr and Karger, 1996] : Given a graph \\( G = (V, E, w) \\) with \\( n = |V| \\) vertices, \\( m = |E| \\) edges, edge weights \\( w_e \\ge 0 \\), and a desired error parameter \\( \\epsilon &gt; 0 \\), a \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) cut sparsifier of \\( G \\) is a subgraph \\( H \\) on the same vertex set \\( V \\) with (possibly) different edge weights, such that \\( H \\) approximates the value of every cut in \\( G \\) within a factor of \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\).\nBenczúr and Karger [Benczúr and Karger, 1996] showed that every undirected graph has a \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) cut sparsifier with only \\( O\\left(\\frac{n \\log n}{\\epsilon^2}\\right) \\) edges.  This was later extended to the stronger notion of spectral sparsifiers [Spielman and Teng, 2011], and the number of edges was improved to \\( O\\left(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}\\right) \\) [BSS, 2012].\nWhat is a for-each cut sketch?\nFor very small values of \\( \\epsilon \\), the \\( 1/\\epsilon^2 \\) dependence in known cut sparsifiers may be prohibitive. Motivated by this, the work of [ACK+, 2016] relaxed the cut sparsification problem to outputting a data structure \\( D \\), such that for any fixed cut \\( S \\subset V \\), the value \\( D(S) \\) is within a \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) factor of the cut value of \\( S \\) in \\( G \\) with probability at least \\( 2/3 \\). Notice the order of quantifiers — the data structure only needs to preserve the value of any fixed cut (chosen independently of its randomness) with high constant probability.\nFormally, we have\n\nDefinition 1. (For-Each Cut Sketch)  Let \\( 0 &lt; \\epsilon &lt; 1 \\) .\nWe say \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a \\((1\\pm\\epsilon)\\) for-each cut sketching algorithm if there exists a recovering algorithm \\(f\\) such that, given a directed graph \\(G = (V, E, w)\\) as input, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nCan output a sketch \\( \\mathrm{sk}(G) \\) such that, for each \\( \\emptyset \\subset S \\subset V \\), with probability at least \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\),\n\\[\n(1 - \\epsilon) \\cdot w(S, V \\setminus S) \\le f(S, \\mathrm{sk}(G)) \\le (1 + \\epsilon) \\cdot w(S, V \\setminus S).\n\\]\nHere \\(w(S, V \\setminus S) \\) denote the total weights of the cut edges between \\(S\\) and \\(V \\setminus S \\).\n\n\nThis is referred to as the for-each model, and the data structure is called a for-each cut sketch. Surprisingly, [ACK+, 2016] showed that every undirected graph has a \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) for-each cut sketch of size \\( \\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon) \\) bits, reducing the dependence on \\( \\epsilon \\) to linear. They also showed an \\( \\Omega(n/\\epsilon) \\) bits lower bound in the for-each model.\nWhat is the case for a directed graph?\nWhile the above results provide a fairly complete picture for undirected graphs, a natural question is whether similar improvements are possible for directed graphs. This is the main question posed by [CCPS, 2021]. For directed graphs, even in the for-each model, there is an \\( \\Omega(n^2) \\) lower bound without any assumptions on the graph: consider the following example in a directed bipartite graph, we can actually choose \\( S \\) to make the cut only contain exact one edge \\((u, v)\\) for every edge \\((u, v)\\) in this graph, which means the sketch must have size \\(\\Omega(n^2)\\).\n\nFigure 1: The cut \\(S\\) only contains a single edge \\((u, v)\\),so any sparsifier must contain this edge\nMotivated by this, [EMPS16, IT18, CCPS21] introduced the notion of \\( \\beta \\)-balanced directed graphs, meaning that for every directed cut \\( (S, V \\setminus S) \\), the total weight of edges from \\( S \\) to \\( V \\setminus S \\) is at most \\( \\beta \\) times that from \\( V \\setminus S \\) to \\( S \\).  Formally, we have\n\nDefinition 2. (\\( \\beta \\)-Balanced Graphs) A strongly connected directed graph \\(G = (V, E, w)\\) is \\(\\beta\\)-balanced if, for all \\(\\emptyset \\subset S \\subset V\\),\nit holds that \\(w(S, V \\setminus S) \\le \\beta \\cdot w(V \\setminus S, S)\\).\n\n\nThe notion of \\( \\beta \\)-balanced graphs turned out to be very useful for directed graphs, as [IT18, CCPS21] showed an \\( \\tilde{O}(n \\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon) \\) upper bound in the for-each model, and an \\( \\tilde{O}(n \\beta/\\epsilon^2) \\) upper bound in the for-all model, thus giving non-trivial bounds for both problems for small values of \\( \\beta \\). The work of [CCPS, 2021] also proved lower bounds: they showed an \\( \\Omega(n \\sqrt{\\beta/\\epsilon}) \\) lower bound in the for-each model, and an \\( \\Omega(n \\beta/\\epsilon) \\) lower bound in the for-all model. While their lower bounds are tight for constant \\( \\epsilon \\), there is a quadratic gap for both models in terms of the dependence on \\( \\beta \\). Therefore, below we ask the main question we will focus on in this blog post.\n\nQuestion 1. What is the tight space complexity of for-each and for-all cut sketch in a \\(\\beta\\)-balanced directed graph?\n\nTight Lower Bound for For-Each Cut Sketch in a \\(\\beta\\)-Balanced Directed Graph\nIn this section, we will give our main result, a tight \\(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n \\sqrt{\\beta} / \\epsilon) \\) lower bound on the output size of \\((1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) for-each cut sketching algorithms (Definition 2). Formally, we have\n\nTheorem 1. Let \\( \\beta \\ge 1 \\) and \\(0 &lt; \\epsilon &lt; 1\\). Assume \\( \\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon \\le n / 2 \\). Any \\( (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\) for-each cut sketching algorithm for \\(\\beta\\)-balanced \\(n\\)-node graphs must output \\( \\tilde{\\Omega}(n \\sqrt{\\beta}/ \\epsilon) \\) bits.\n\n\nWe remark in our full version of the paper, we also give a tight \\( \\tilde{\\Omega}(n \\beta / \\epsilon^2) \\) lower bound for the for-all cut sketch. For more information we refer the readers there.\nA common technique we use for the two problems is communication complexity games that involve the approximation parameter \\(\\epsilon\\).\nFor example, suppose Alice has a bit string \\(s\\) of length \\( (1/\\epsilon^2) \\), and she can encode \\(s\\) into a graph \\(G\\) such that, if she sends Bob a \\( (1\\pm\\epsilon) \\) (for-each or for-all) cut sketch to Bob, then Bob can recover any specific bit of \\( s \\) with high constant probability.\nBy communication complexity lower bounds, we know Alice must send \\( \\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2) \\) bits to Bob, which gives a lower bound on the size of the cut sketch. In the for-each sketch, we will consider the following Index problem\n\nLemma 1.  (Index)\nSuppose Alice has a uniformly random string \\(s \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^n\\) and Bob has a uniformly random index \\(i \\in [n]\\). If Alice sends a single (possibly randomized) message to Bob, and Bob can recover \\(s_{i}\\) with probability at least \\(2/3\\) (over the randomness in the input and their protocol), then Alice must send \\(\\Omega(n)\\) bits to Bob.\n\n\nIntuitively, consider a basic encoding method [ACK+15, CCPS21] where each bit \\(s_i\\) is represented by an edge \\((u, v)\\) in a bipartite graph \\(G(L, R, E)\\), with a weight of either 1 or 2. After encoding, we query the edges leaving a set \\(S = {u} \\cup (R \\setminus {v})\\) to decode the bit \\(s_i\\) which the edge \\((u, v)\\) represents (see Figure 1 for an example). In this setup, to make the bipartite graph \\(\\beta\\)-balanced, the backward edges from \\(R\\) to \\(L\\) are assigned a weight of \\(1/\\beta\\), and these backward edges contribute to a cut value of \\(\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2)\\) (under the optimal parameters that correspond to \\(\\Omega(n\\sqrt{\\beta} / \\epsilon)\\) lower bound). The \\((1 \\pm \\epsilon)\\) cut sketch then introduces an additive error of \\(\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)\\), which is much larger than \\(\\Theta(1)\\), making it difficult to distinguish the values of \\(s_i = \\{-1, 1\\}\\). To overcome this, we instead encode \\(1/\\epsilon^2\\) bits of information across \\(1/\\epsilon^2\\) edges at the same time. When we want to decode a specific bit \\(s_i\\), we query the (directed) cut values between two carefully selected subsets \\(A \\in L_i\\) and \\(B \\in R_j\\). The key idea in our construction is that, even though each edge in \\(A \\times B\\) encodes multiple bits of \\(s\\), the encoding of different bits of \\(s\\) remains minimally correlated: encoding other bits does influence the total weight from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), but this effect is akin to adding noise, which only causes a small fluctuation in the total weight from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\nThis construction is based on the following technical lemma.\n\nLemma 2.\nFor any integer \\(k \\ge 1\\), there exists a matrix \\(M \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{(2^k - 1)^2 \\times 2^{2k}}\\) such that: (1) \\(\\langle M_t, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = 0  \\) for all \\(t \\in [(2^k - 1)^2]\\). (2) \\(\\langle M_t, M_{t’}\\rangle = 0\\) for all \\(1 \\le t &lt; t’ \\le (2^k - 1)^2\\). (3) For all \\(t \\in [(2^k - 1)^2]\\), the \\(t\\)-th row of \\(M\\) can be written as \\(M_t = u \\otimes v\\) where \\(u, v \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{2^k}\\) and \\(\\langle u, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = \\langle v, \\mathbf{1}\\rangle = 0\\).\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2\nOur construction is based on the Hadamard matrix \\(H = H_{2^k} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{2^k \\times 2^k}\\). Recall that the first row of \\(H\\) is the all-ones vector and that \\(\\langle H_i, H_j \\rangle = 0\\) for all \\(i \\ne j\\).\nFor every \\(2 \\le i, j \\le 2^k\\), we add \\(H_i \\otimes H_j \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{2^{2k}}\\) as a row of \\(M\\), so \\(M\\) has \\((2^k - 1)^2\\) rows.\nCondition (3) holds because \\(\\langle H_i, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = \\langle H_j, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = 0\\) for all \\(i, j \\ge 2\\).\nFor Conditions (1) and (2), note that for any vectors \\(u, v, w\\), and \\(z\\), we have \\(\\langle u\\otimes v, w \\otimes z \\rangle= \\langle u, w \\rangle \\langle v, z \\rangle \\).\nUsing this fact, Condition (1) holds because \\(\\langle M_t, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = \\langle H_i \\otimes H_j, \\mathbf{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = \\langle H_i, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle \\langle H_j, \\mathbf{1} \\rangle = 0\\),\nand Condition (2) holds because \\((i,j) \\neq (i’,j’)\\) and thus \\(\\langle M_t, M_{t’} \\rangle = \\langle H_i \\otimes H_j, H_{i’} \\otimes H_{j’} \\rangle = \\langle H_{i}, H_{i’}\\rangle \\langle H_{j}, H_{j’}\\rangle  = 0 \\). \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\square\\)\nWe first prove a lower bound for the special case \\(n = \\Theta(\\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon)\\). Our proof for this special case introduces important building blocks for proving the general case \\(n = \\Omega(\\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon)\\).\n\nLemma 3.\nSuppose \\(n = \\Theta(\\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon)\\). Any \\((1 \\pm \\epsilon)\\) for-each cut sketching algorithm for \\(\\beta\\)-balanced \\(n\\)-node graphs must output \\(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n \\sqrt{\\beta}/ \\epsilon) = \\tilde{\\Omega}(\\beta/ \\epsilon^2)\\) bits.\n\n\nAt a high level, we reduce the Index problem (Lemma 1) to the for-each cut sketching problem.\nGiven Alice’s string \\(s\\), we construct a graph \\(G\\) to encode \\(s\\), such that Bob can recover any single bit in \\(s\\) by querying \\(O(1)\\) cut values of \\(G\\). Our lower bound (Lemma 3) then follows from the communication complexity lower bound of the Index problem (Lemma 1), because Alice can run a for-each cut sketching algorithm and send the cut sketch to Bob, and Bob can successfully recover the \\(O(1)\\) cut values with high constant probability from the cut sketch.\nProof of Lemma 3.\nWe reduce from the Index problem.  Let \\(s \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{\\beta(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1)^2}\\) denote Alice’s random string.\nConstruction of \\(G\\).   We construct a directed complete bipartite graph \\(G\\) to encode \\(s\\). Let \\(L\\) and \\(R\\) denote the left and right nodes of \\(G\\), where \\(|L| = |R| = \\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon\\). We partition \\(L\\) into \\(\\sqrt{\\beta}\\) disjoint blocks \\(L_1, \\ldots, L_{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\) of equal size, and similarly partition \\(R\\) into \\(R_1, \\ldots, R_{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\). We divide \\(s\\) into \\(\\beta\\) disjoint strings \\(s_{i,j} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1)^2}\\) of the same length. We will encode \\(s_{i,j}\\) using the edges from \\(L_i\\) to \\(R_j\\). Note that the encoding of each \\(s_{i,j}\\) is independent since \\(E(L_i, R_j) \\cap E(L_{i’}, R_{j’}) = \\varnothing\\) for \\((i, j) \\neq (i’, j’)\\).\nWe fix \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and focus on the encoding of \\(s_{i,j}\\). Note that \\(|L_i| = |R_j| = 1/\\epsilon\\). We refer to the edges from \\(L_i\\) to \\(R_j\\) as forward edges and the edges from \\(R_j\\) to \\(L_i\\) as backward edges. Let \\(w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1/\\epsilon^2}\\) denote the weights of the forward edges, which we will choose soon. Every backward edge has weight \\(1/\\beta\\).\nLet \\(z = s_{i,j} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1)^2}\\). Assume w.l.o.g. that \\(1/\\epsilon = 2^t\\) for some integer \\(t\\). Consider the vector \\(x = \\sum_{t=1}^{(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1)^2} z_t M_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1/\\epsilon^2}\\) where \\(M\\) is the matrix in Lemma 2 with \\(2^k = 1/\\epsilon\\). Because \\(z_t \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\) is uniformly random, each coordinate of \\(x\\) is a sum of \\(O(1/\\epsilon^2)\\) i.i.d. random variables of value \\(\\pm 1\\). By the Chernoff bound and the union bound, we know that with probability at least \\(99/100\\), \\(|x|_{\\infty} \\le c_1 \\ln(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon\\) for some constant \\(c_1 &gt; 0\\). If this happens, we set \\(w = \\epsilon x + 2 c_1 \\ln(1/\\epsilon) \\mathbf{1}\\), so that each entry of \\(w\\) is between \\(c_1 \\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) and \\(3 c_1 \\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). Otherwise, we set \\(w = 2 c_1 \\ln(1/\\epsilon) \\mathbf{1}\\) to indicate that the encoding failed.\nWe first verify that \\(G\\) is \\(O(\\beta \\log(1/\\epsilon))\\)-balanced. This is because every edge has a reverse edge with similar weight: For every \\(u \\in L\\) and \\(v \\in R\\), the edge \\((u, v)\\) has weight \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\), while the edge \\((v, u)\\) has weight \\(1/\\beta\\).\nRecovering a Bit in \\(s\\) from a For-Each Cut Sketch of \\(G\\). Suppose Bob wants to recover a specific bit of \\(s\\), which belongs to the substring \\(z = s_{i,j}\\) and has an index \\(t\\) in \\(z\\). We assume that \\(z\\) is successfully encoded by the subgraph between \\(L_i\\) and \\(R_j\\).\nFor simplicity, we index the nodes in \\(L_i\\) as \\(1, \\ldots, (1/\\epsilon)\\) and similarly for \\(R_j\\). We index the forward edges \\((u, v)\\) in alphabetical order, first by \\(u \\in L_i\\) and then by \\(v \\in R_j\\). Under this notation, \\(\\langle w, \\mathbf{1}_{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{B} \\rangle\\) gives the total weight \\(w(A, B)\\) of forward edges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), where \\(\\mathbf{1}_{A}, \\mathbf{1}_{B} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{1/\\epsilon}\\) are the indicator vectors of \\(A \\subset L_i\\) and \\(B \\subset R_j\\).The crucial observation is that, given a cut sketch of \\(G\\), Bob can approximate \\(\\langle w, M_t\\rangle\\) using \\(4\\) cut queries. By Lemma 2, \\(M_t = h_A \\otimes h_B\\) for some \\(h_A, h_B \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{1/\\epsilon}\\). Let \\(A \\subset L_i\\) be the set of nodes \\(u \\in L_i\\) with \\(h_A(u) = 1\\). Let \\(B \\subset R_i\\) be the set of nodes \\(v \\in R_j\\) with \\(h_B(v) = 1\\). Let \\(\\bar{A} = L_i \\setminus A\\) and \\(\\bar{B} = R_j \\setminus B\\).\n\\[\n\\langle w, M_t\\rangle = \\langle w, h_A \\otimes h_B\\rangle = \\langle w, (\\mathbf{1}_{A} - \\mathbf{1}_{\\bar{A}}) \\otimes (\\mathbf{1}_{B} - \\mathbf{1}_{\\bar{B}})\\rangle = w(A, B) - w(\\bar{A}, B) - w(A, \\bar{B}) + w(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})\n\\]\nTo approximate the value of \\(w(A, B)\\) (and similarly \\(w(\\bar{A}, B)\\), \\(w(A, \\bar{B})\\), \\(w(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})\\)), Bob can query \\(w(S, V \\setminus S)\\) for \\(S = A \\cup (R \\setminus B)\\). The edges from \\(S\\) to \\(V \\setminus S\\) consist of forward edges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and backward edges from \\(R \\setminus B\\) to \\(L \\setminus A\\). See Figure 2 as an example.\n\nFigure 2: For \\(S = A \\cup(R \\setminus B)\\), the (directed) edges from \\(S\\) to \\( V \\setminus S \\) consist of the following: the forward edges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), each with weight \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\), and the backward edges from \\(R \\setminus B\\) to \\(L \\setminus A\\), each with weight \\(1/\\beta\\).\nBy Lemma 2, \\(\\langle h_A, \\mathbf{1}\\rangle = \\langle h_B, \\mathbf{1}\\rangle = 0\\), so \\(|A| = |B| = \\frac{|L_i|}{2} = \\frac{|R_j|}{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}\\). The total weight of the forward edges is \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon) / \\epsilon^2)\\), and the total weight of the backward edges is \\(\\bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta}}{\\epsilon}-\\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}\\bigr)^2\\frac{1}{\\beta} = \\Theta(1/\\epsilon^2)\\), so the cut value \\(w(S, V \\setminus S)\\) is \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^2)\\). Given a \\((1 \\pm \\frac{c_2 \\epsilon}{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)})\\) for-each cut sketch, Bob can obtain a \\((1 \\pm \\frac{c_2\\epsilon}{\\log(1/\\epsilon)})\\) multiplicative approximation of \\(w(S, V \\setminus S)\\), which has \\(O(c_2/\\epsilon)\\) additive error. After subtracting the total weight of backward edges, which is fixed, Bob has an estimate of \\(w(A, B)\\) with \\(O(c_2/\\epsilon)\\) additive error.  Consequently, Bob can approximate \\(\\langle w, M_t\\rangle\\) with \\(O(c_2/\\epsilon)\\) additive error using \\(4\\) cut queries.\nNow consider \\(\\langle w, M_t\\rangle\\). By Lemma 2, \\(\\langle M_t, \\mathbf{1}\\rangle = 0\\) and the rows of \\(M\\) are orthogonal:\n\\[\n\\langle w, M_t\\rangle = \\langle \\epsilon x, M_t\\rangle = \\epsilon \\langle \\sum_{t’} z_{t’} M_{t’}, M_t\\rangle = \\epsilon \\left(\\sum_{t’} z_{t’} \\langle M_t, M_{t’}\\rangle\\right) = \\epsilon z_t |M_t|_2^2 = \\frac{z_t}{\\epsilon}\n\\]\nWe can see that, for a sufficiently small universal constant \\(c_2\\), Bob can distinguish whether \\(z_t = 1\\) or \\(z_t = -1\\) based on an \\(O(c_2/\\epsilon)\\) additive approximation of \\(\\langle w, M_t\\rangle\\). Bob’s success probability is at least \\(0.95\\), because the encoding of \\(z\\) fails with probability at most \\(0.01\\), and each of the \\(4\\) cut queries fails with probability at most \\(0.01\\). (Note that the success probability of a cut query given a for-each cut sketch (Definition 1) can be boosted from \\(2/3\\) to \\(99/100\\), e.g., by running the sketching and recovering algorithms \\(O(1)\\) times and taking the median. This increases the length of Alice’s message by a constant factor, which does not affect our asymptotic lower bound.) \\(\\ \\ \\square\\)\nWe next consider the case with general values of \\(n\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\), and prove Theorem 1.\nProof of Theorem 1.\nLet \\(k = \\sqrt{\\beta} / \\epsilon\\). We assume w.l.o.g. that \\(k\\) is an integer, \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(k\\), and \\((1/\\epsilon)\\) is a power of \\(2\\). Suppose Alice has a random string \\(s \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{\\Omega(nk)}\\). We will show that \\(s\\) can be encoded into a graph \\(G\\) such that:\n\n\\(G\\) has \\(n\\) nodes and is \\(O(\\beta \\log(1/\\epsilon))\\)-balanced, and\nGiven a \\((1 \\pm \\frac{c_2\\epsilon} {\\ln(1/\\epsilon)})\\) for-each cut sketch of \\(G\\) and an index \\(q\\), where \\(c_2 &gt; 0\\) is a sufficiently small universal constant, Bob can recover \\(s_q\\) with probability at least \\(2/3\\).\n\nConsequently, by Lemma 1, any for-each cut sketching algorithm must output \\(\\Omega(nk) = \\Omega(n \\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon) = \\tilde{\\Omega}(n \\sqrt{\\beta’}/\\epsilon’)\\) bits for \\(\\beta’ = O(\\beta \\log(1/\\epsilon))\\) and \\(\\epsilon’ = c_2 \\epsilon / \\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\).\nWe first describe the construction of \\(G\\). We partition the \\(n\\) nodes into \\(\\ell = n / k \\ge 2\\) disjoint sets \\(V_1, \\ldots, V_\\ell\\), each containing \\(k\\) nodes. Let \\(s\\) be Alice’s random string with length \\(\\beta (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1)^2 (\\ell-1) = \\Omega(k^2 \\ell)= \\Omega(nk)\\).  We partition \\(s\\) into \\((\\ell - 1)\\) strings \\((s_i)_{i=1}^{\\ell - 1}\\), with \\(k^2\\) bits in each substring.  We then follow the same procedure as in Lemma 3 to encode \\(s_i\\) into a complete bipartite graph between \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_{i+1}\\). Notice that we have \\(|s_i| = \\beta (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1)^2 \\) and \\(|V_i| = |V_{i+1}| = \\sqrt{\\beta}/\\epsilon\\), which is the same setting as in Lemma 3.\nWe can verify that \\(G\\) is \\(O(\\beta\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\)-balanced. This is because every edge \\(e\\) has a reverse edge whose weight is at most \\(O(\\beta\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\) times the weight of \\(e\\). For every \\(u \\in V_i\\) and \\(v \\in V_{i+1}\\), the edge \\((u, v)\\) has weight \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\), while the edge \\((v, u)\\) has weight \\(1/\\beta\\).\nWe next show that Bob can recover the \\(q\\)-th bit of \\(s\\). Suppose Bob’s index \\(q\\) belongs to the substring \\(s_i\\) which is encoded by the subgraph between \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V_{i+1}\\). Similar to the proof of Lemma 3, Bob only needs to approximate \\(w(A, B)\\) for \\(4\\) pairs of \\((A, B)\\) with \\(O(1/\\epsilon)\\) additive error, where \\(A \\subset V_i\\), \\(B \\subset V_{i+1}\\), and \\(|A| = |B| = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}\\). To achieve this, Bob can query the cut value \\(w(S, V \\setminus S)\\) for \\(S = A \\cup \\left(V_{i + 1} \\setminus B\\right) \\bigcup_{j = i + 2}^{\\ell} V_j\\). The edges from \\(S\\) to \\((V \\setminus S)\\) are:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{4\\epsilon^2}\\) forward edges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), each with weight \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\).\n\\(\\bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta}}{\\epsilon}-\\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}\\bigr)^2\\) backward edges from \\((V_{i+1} \\setminus B)\\) to \\((V_{i} \\setminus A)\\), each with weight \\(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\).\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta}}{2\\epsilon^2}\\) backward edges from \\(A\\) to \\(V_{i - 1}\\) when \\(i \\ge 2\\), each with weight \\(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\).\n\nThe cut value \\(w(S, V \\setminus S)\\) is \\(\\Theta(\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^2)\\). Consequently, given a \\((1 \\pm \\frac{c_2\\epsilon} {\\ln(1/\\epsilon)})\\) for-each cut sketch, after subtracting the fixed weight of the backward edges, Bob can approximate \\(w(A, B)\\) with \\(O(c_2/\\epsilon)\\) additive error. Similar to the proof of Lemma 3, for sufficiently small constant \\(c_2 &gt; 0\\), repeating this process for \\(4\\) different pairs of \\((A, B)\\) will allow Bob to recover \\(s_q \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\). \\(\\square\\)\nReferences\n[Benczúr and Karger, 1996]: András A.

It has\na number of practical use cases. For example, when executing a client’s program\nin cloud computing, a cloud-service provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services or\nMicrosoft Azure) would like to to avoid both over-provisioning resources (which\nwould reduce profits) and under-provisioning resources (which would violate the\nservice-level agreement). So the provider would like to to estimate the resource\nusage of the client’s program in advance, thereby optimizing resource\nallocation.\nThere are two approaches to resource analysis: static analysis and\ndata-driven analysis. Static analysis infers a cost bound by examining the\nsource code and reasoning about all theoretically possible behaviors of a\nprogram, including its worst-case behavior. Data-driven analysis\nfirst runs the program on many inputs and records the execution costs. It then\nanalyzes the cost measurements to infer a cost bound.\nStatic and data-driven analyses have complementary strengths and weaknesses.\nStatic analysis is sound: if it returns some candidate cost bound, it is\nguaranteed to be a valid upper bound on the actual execution cost. However,\nresource analysis for a Turing-complete language is generally undecidable.\nConsequently, static analysis is incomplete: no matter how clever the static\nanalysis is, there always exists a program that the static analysis cannot\nhandle. In contrast to static analysis, data-driven analysis can infer a cost\nbound for any program. However, because data-driven analysis cannot rigorously\nreason about the program’s worst-case behavior, data-driven analysis offers no\nsoundness guarantees of its inferred cost bounds.\nIn this blog post, we describe how to integrate static and data-driven resource\nanalyses into hybrid resource analysis. By combining the two complementary\nanalysis techniques, hybrid resource analysis partially retains their respective\nstrengths while mitigating their weaknesses. We first introduce static resource\nanalysis, followed by data-driven resource analysis. We then describe hybrid\nresource analysis and demonstrate its advantages over static and data-driven\nanalyses using an example of a linear-time selection algorithm.\nFormulation of Resource Analysis\nGiven a program \\(P\\), the goal of resource analysis is to infer its\nworst-case cost bound. Concretely, it is a function \\(\\text{cost}_{P} (x)\\)\nparametric in an input \\(x\\) (or its size \\(\\lvert x \\rvert\\)) to the\nprogram \\(P\\) such that, for any input \\(x\\), the value \\(\\text{cost}_{P}\n(x)\\) is a correct upper bound of the execution cost of \\(P(x)\\). The\nexecution cost of the program \\(P\\) is defined by a resource metric such as\nrunning time, memory, or energy.\nTo specify a resource metric of interest, a user inserts an instruction tick q\nthroughout their code, where q is a (positive or negative) number. The\ninstruction indicates that q many resources are consumed. For example, if we\nare interested in the amount of memory (in bits) consumed by a program, whenever\na 64-bit memory cell is allocated in the source code, we indicate it by\ninserting an instruction tick 64.\nStatic Analysis\nTo automate resource analysis, static resource analysis automatically analyzes\nthe source code of a program. In this blog post, we focus on Automatic\nAmortized Resource Analysis\n(AARA) as a concrete example of state-of-the-art static resource analysis.\nTaking as input a functional program \\(P\\), AARA tries to automatically infer\na polynomial cost bound of the program \\(P\\).\nAARA\nAARA builds on the potential method from amortized\nanalysis. Every data structure\nduring program execution is equipped with potential, which we can consider as\nfuel for computation. To perform computation, data structures must come with\nenough potential to pay for the cost of computation. For example, if we are to\nrun an instruction tick 64, we must have at least 64 units of potential\navailable. The remaining potential can be later used to pay for subsequent\ncomputation. In the potential method, our goal is to figure out an appropriate\namount of potential to store in data structures such that, whenever they go\nthrough computation, they have enough potential to pay for it. The overall cost\nis then bounded above by the initial potential minus the final potential stored\nin the data structures. So the difference between the initial and final\npotential serves as a cost bound.\nAARA uses types to express the amount of potential stored in data structures.\nFor illustration, consider a variable \\(x\\) of the integer-list type \\(\nL(\\mathtt{int}) \\). If we want the list \\(x\\) to come with one unit of\npotential per list element, we write\n$$\nx: L^{1} (\\mathtt{int})\n$$\nwhere the superscript 1 indicates the amount of potential stored in each list\nelement. The type \\(L^{1} (\\mathtt{int})\\) is called a resource-annotated\ntype, and the superscript 1 is called a resource annotation.\nLet’s look at a slightly more complicated example. Consider function split\nthat splits an input list \\(x\\) into two equal halves. The function traverses\nthe input \\(x\\) and processes each list element. If the cost of processing\neach element is one, the total computational cost is equal to the input list\nlength \\( \\lvert x \\rvert\\). We express the resource usage of the function\nsplit by\n$$\nx : L^{1} (\\mathtt{int}) \\vdash \\mathtt{split} \\; x : L^{0} (\\mathtt{int}) \\times L^{0} (\\mathtt{int})\n$$\nOn the left-hand side of the turnstile (i.e., \\(\\vdash\\)), we have \\(x :\nL^{1} (\\mathtt{int})\\), which means the input \\(x\\) carries one unit of\npotential per element. On the right-hand side of the turnstile, we have\n\\(\\mathtt{split} \\; x : L^{0} (\\mathtt{int}) \\times L^{0} (\\mathtt{int})\\),\nwhich means the two output lists of function split each carry zero units of\npotential per element. This assignment of potential makes sense. In the input\nlist \\(x\\), each element initially carries one unit of potential. This\npotential is used to pay for the cost of function split, and the\nremaining zero units of potential are stored in the two output lists after\nsplitting. The difference between the input potential (i.e., \\(1 \\cdot \\lvert x\n\\rvert\\)) and output potential (i.e., zero) immediately translates to the cost\nbound \\(\\lvert x \\vert\\) of function split.\nAlthough the function split stores zero potential in the output, we will need\na positive amount of potential in the output if it later undergoes computation\nthat demands potential. In such a case, we can increase the potential stored in\nthe input and output of the function split. For example, another valid\nassignment of potential is\n$$\nx : L^{3} (\\mathtt{int}) \\vdash \\mathtt{split} \\; x : L^{2} (\\mathtt{int}) \\times L^{2} (\\mathtt{int})\n$$\nwhere the input carries three units of potential per list element and the output\ncarries two unit of potential, which can be used to pay for subsequent\ncomputation.\nGiven a program \\(P\\), how do we infer its resource-annotated type? First, we\nassign numeric variables to all inputs and outputs that appear in \\(P\\)’s\nsource code. These variables stand for (yet-to-be-determined) resource\nannotations, which encode the amounts of potential. For example, in the program\n\\(\\mathtt{split} \\; x\\), the input and output of the whole program are\nassigned variables \\(q_0, q_1, q_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\):\n$$\nx : L^{q_0} (\\mathtt{int}) \\vdash \\mathtt{split} \\; x : L^{q_1} (\\mathtt{int}) \\times L^{q_2} (\\mathtt{int})\n$$\nWe then walk through the source code, collecting linear constraints that relate\nthe variables assigned to the inputs and outputs. For example, if the program\n\\(P\\) contains instruction tick 64, AARA’s type system imposes a linear\nconstraint that the input potential must be at least 64 plus the leftover\npotential after running tick 64. In the example of \\(\\mathtt{split} \\; x\\),\nwe obtain two linear constraints\n$$\nq_1 + 1 \\leq q_0 \\qquad q_2 + 1 \\leq q_0\n$$\nFinally, we solve the linear constraints using a linear-program (LP) solver. If\nwe obtain a solution, we can extract a resource-annotated type of the program\n\\(P\\).\nIncompleteness\nThe static resource analysis technique AARA is sound but incomplete. Soundness\nmeans that, if AARA returns a candidate cost bound, it is guaranteed to be a\nvalid worst-case cost bound. However, AARA is incomplete: even if a program\n\\(P\\) has a polynomial cost bound, AARA can fail to infer it. This happens\nwhen the linear constraints collected during type inference are unsolvable. In\nfact, this limitation is not unique to AARA. All static resource analysis\ntechniques suffer incompleteness because resource analysis is undecidable in\ngeneral.\nTo illustrate AARA’s incompleteness, let us consider the median-of-medians-based\nlinear-time selection algorithm. Given an input list \\(x\\) and an input\ninteger \\(i\\), the selection algorithm returns the \\(i\\)-th smallest element\nin the list \\(x\\).\nIn this algorithm, we split input list \\(x\\) into blocks of five elements and\ncompute each block’s median (e.g., by brute force). We then recursively call the\nalgorithm on these medians to compute their median \\(m\\). The median of\nmedians \\(m\\) (hence the name of the algorithm) is used to partition the input\nlist \\(x\\) into two lists, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). To prove the linear time\ncomplexity of this algorithm, we must show that the sublists \\(x_1\\) and\n\\(x_2\\) are each at most \\(7/10\\) of the list \\(x\\). Intuitively, the\nmedian of medians \\(m\\) partitions the list \\(x\\) evenly (up to some\nfactor) even in the worst case.\nHowever, AARA cannot reason about the mathematical properties of medians. As a\nresult, it cannot conclude that the median of medians \\(m\\) splits the list\n\\(x\\) evenly. Instead, AARA deduces that, in the worst case, the list \\(x\\)\nis split unevenly into a singleton list (i.e., containing only one element) and\nthe remaining sublist. If the list \\(x\\) were split this way, the worst-case\ntime complexity would be exponential. Hence, AARA is unable to infer a\npolynomial cost bound for this algorithm even though it has a linear cost bound.\nFurthermore, we are not aware of static analysis techniques that can correctly\ninfer linear cost bounds for the linear-time selection algorithm.\nData-Driven Analysis\nThe second approach to automatic resource analysis is data-driven resource\nanalysis. It starts with collecting cost measurements of the program \\(P\\).\nGiven inputs \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), we run \\( P \\; x_i \\) for each \\(1\n\\leq i \\leq n\\) and record its output  \\( y_{i} \\) and execution cost \\(c_i\n\\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\). This yields a runtime cost dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)\ndefined as\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} \\coloneqq \\{ (x_i, y_i, c_i) \\mid 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\}\n$$\nThe dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) records output \\(y_i\\) as well as input\n\\(x_i\\) since we need to know output sizes to calculate a cost bound (i.e.,\nthe difference between the input and output potential). We then infer a cost\nbound of the program \\(P\\) by analyzing the dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). We have\na variety of choices for data-analysis techniques, ranging from linear\nregression to deep learning.\nBayesian Resource Analysis\nThis blog post introduces Bayesian resource analysis, where we apply Bayesian\ninference to resource analysis. In abstract, the goal of Bayesian inference is\nto infer latent variables \\(\\theta\\) (i.e., variables that we want to know\nbut cannot observe) from observed variables \\(D\\) (i.e., variables whose\nconcrete values are available) using Bayes’ rule from probability theory. In\nBayesian resource analysis, latent variables \\(\\theta\\) are resource\nannotations (i.e., cost bounds), and observed variables \\(D\\) are the runtime\ncost dataset of the program.\nTo conduct Bayesian resource analysis, the user first provides a probabilistic\nmodel, which specifies a joint probability distribution \\( p (\\theta, D) \\)\nof resource annotations \\(\\theta\\) and dataset \\(D\\). Next, by Bayes’ rule,\nthe posterior distribution of the cost bound \\(\\theta\\) conditioned on a\nconcrete dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is given by\n$$\np (\\theta \\mid D = \\mathcal{D})\n= \\frac{p (\\theta, D = \\mathcal{D})}{p (D = \\mathcal{D})}\n= \\frac{p (\\theta, D = \\mathcal{D})}{\\int p (\\theta, D = \\mathcal{D}) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\theta}\n$$\nThis equation suggests that we can compute the posterior distribution \\(p\n(\\theta \\mid D = \\mathcal{D})\\) by taking the ratio between the joint\ndistribution \\(p (\\theta, D = \\mathcal{D})\\) and the denominator \\(\\int p\n(\\theta, D = \\mathcal{D}) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\theta\\). However, because the\ndenominator is an integral over the space of the resource annotations\n\\(\\theta\\), which may have many dimensions, it is often intractable to compute\nthe denominator. As a result, we cannot precisely compute the posterior\ndistribution \\(p (\\theta \\mid D = \\mathcal{D})\\) by directly applying Bayes’\nrule.\nInstead, in practice, we run a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm,\ndrawing a large number of samples from the posterior distribution. We then use\nthese samples, which serve as an approximation of the posterior distribution, to\nestimate various properties (e.g., mean, median, variance, etc.) of the\nposterior distribution.\nFigure 1 displays a schematic diagram of Bayesian resource analysis. We perform\nBayesian inference to infer a posterior distribution of cost bounds (blue lines)\nfrom the runtime cost measurements (black dots).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of Bayesian resource analysis. We perform Bayesian\ninference to infer a posterior distribution of cost bounds (blue lines) from the\nruntime cost measurements (black dots).\n\n\nTo illustrate Bayesian resource analysis, consider the function split that was\nintroduced earlier. Its resource-annotated type has the form\n$$\nx : L^{q_0} (\\mathtt{int}) \\vdash \\mathtt{split} \\; x : L^{q_1} (\\mathtt{int}) \\times L^{q_2} (\\mathtt{int})\n$$\nwhere the resource annotations \\(q_0, q_1, q_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\) are\nto be inferred by Bayesian inference.\nLet a dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of runtime cost\nmeasurements be\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} \\coloneqq \\{(x_i,(y_{i,1}, y_{i,2}),c_i) \\mid 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\}\n$$\nwhere \\(x_i\\) is an input list, \\((y_{i,1}, y_{i,2})\\) is a pair of\ntwo output lists, and \\(c_i\\) is the cost of running \\(\\mathtt{split} \\;\nx_i\\).\nThe user constructs a probabilistic model \\(p (\\theta, D)\\) based on whatever\ndomain knowledge1 they have. For example, a probabilistic\nmodel for split can be\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_0, q_1, q_2 &amp; \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}_{[0, \\infty)}(0, 5) \\\\\nc_{i, \\text{predict}} &amp; = q_0 \\lvert x_i \\rvert - q_1 \\lvert y_{i,1} \\rvert - q_2 \\lvert y_{i,2} \\rvert &amp; \\qquad (i = 1, \\ldots, n) \\\\\nc_i &amp; \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}_{[0, c_{i, \\text{predict}}]}(c_{i, \\text{predict}}, 2) &amp; (i = 1, \\ldots, n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe first line states that the resource annotations \\(q_0, q_1, q_2\\) follow a\nnormal distribution truncated to the non-negative region. In the second line,\nthe predicted costs \\(c_{i, \\text{predict}}\\) are defined as \\( q_1 \\lvert\nv_i \\rvert - q_2 \\lvert y_{i,1} \\rvert - q_3 \\lvert y_{i,2} \\rvert \\),\nwhich is the difference between input and output potential. The third line\nstates that the observed costs \\(c_i\\) from the dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)\nfollow a normal distribution truncated to the interval \\([0, c_{i,\n\\text{predict}}]\\). The distribution is truncated because the prediction of a\nworst-case cost bound must be larger than or equal to the observed cost.\nUnsoundness\nData-driven analysis can infer a cost bound for any program \\(P\\), provided\nthat it terminates. When we construct a dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of the program\n\\(P\\)’s runtime cost measurements, the program must terminate on all inputs;\notherwise, we will never finish collecting runtime cost measurements. Once we\nfinish data collection, we statistically infer a polynomial cost bound from the\ndataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). As the dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is finite, for any\ndegree \\(d \\geq 0\\), we always have some degree-\\(d\\) polynomial bound\n\\(\\text{cost}_P\\) that lies above all runtime cost measurements of\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\). Therefore, data-driven analysis always returns an inference\nresult.\nHowever, data-driven analysis lacks the soundness guarantee2 of\ninference results. Data-driven analysis examines runtime cost data of the input\nprogram \\(P\\), rather than its source code. Consequently, data-driven analysis\ncannot reason about the theoretically worst-case behavior of the program\n\\(P\\), failing to provide a soundness guarantee.\nFor illustration, we ran Bayesian resource analysis on the\nmedian-of-medians-based linear-time selection algorithm. To collect cost\nmeasurements, we randomly generated input lists. Figure 2 plots the inferred\nposterior distribution of cost bounds. Black dots are runtime cost measurements.\nThe light-blue shade is the 10-90th percentile range of the posterior\ndistribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line is the\ntrue worst-case cost bound.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Inference result of Bayesian resource analysis for the linear-time\nselection algorithm. Black dots are runtime cost measurements. The light-blue\nshade is the 10-90th percentile range of the cost bounds sampled from the\nposterior distribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line\nis the true worst-case cost bound.\n\n\nAlthough the inferred cost bounds (light-blue shade) all lie above the observed\ncosts (black dots), they are unsound worst-case cost bounds since they lie below\nthe true worst-case cost bound (red line). The true cost bound (red line) is\nsignificantly larger than observed costs (black dots) because, when inputs are\nrandomly generated, the worst-case behavior of the selection algorithm rarely\narises.\nCertainly, we can fix this problem by adjusting the probabilistic model such\nthat it adds more buffer on top of the maximum observed costs in the dataset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\). However, it is difficult to tell a priori how much buffer we\nshould add. On the other hand, static analysis is better suited for reasoning\nabout the worst-case behavior than data-driven analysis. But if we perform\nstatic analysis on the entire source code of the linear-time selection\nalgorithm, the analysis fails as described earlier. Can we\nperform static analysis on a fragment of the source code and data-driven\nanalysis on the rest?\nHybrid Analysis\nTo overcome the limitations of purely static analysis (e.g., conventional AARA)\nand purely data-driven analysis (e.g., Bayesian resource analysis), we integrate\nthem into a framework called hybrid AARA.\nHybrid AARA\nFirst, a user indicates which part of the source code should be analyzed by\ndata-driven analysis. For example, if we want expression e to be analyzed by\ndata-driven analysis, we enclose e with the annotation statistics, resulting\nin statistics(e). The rest of the source code will be analyzed by static\nanalysis. To construct a dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of runtime cost measurements,\nwe run the program \\(P\\) on many inputs (to \\(P\\)) and record the inputs,\noutputs, and costs of the expression e inside statistics(e). Here, the input\nto the expression e is its evaluation context (i.e., the values of free\nvariables appearing in e) during the program \\(P\\)’s execution.\nThe data-driven analysis of the expression e incorporates its contextual\ninformation at runtime as the dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) captures this contextual\ninformation. For example, suppose statistics(e) appears inside the if-branch\nof a conditional expression if ... then ... else .... If the if-branch\nsatisfies some invariant (e.g., inside the if-branch, variable x appearing\ninside e is even), then all measurements recorded in the dataset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\) satisfy this invariant. Thus, data-driven analysis does not\nanalyze the expression e in isolation from its context.\nNext, we infer a cost bound in hybrid AARA. Given a program \\(P\\) containing\nstatistics(e) for some expression e, we perform data-driven analysis on e\nand static analysis on the rest of the source code, and then combine their\ninference results. Just like we did for the cost-bound inference of\nconventional AARA, we assign variables to inputs and outputs throughout\nthe source code of the program \\(P\\), where these variables stand for\nyet-to-be-inferred resource annotations. In hybrid AARA, however, we do not\nassign variables inside the expression e. That is, the expression e is\ntreated as a black box whose source code is invisible. Let \\(\\theta_e\\) be the\nset of resource annotations in the input and output of the expression\nstatistics(e). Also, let \\(\\theta \\supseteq \\theta_e\\) be a set of all\nvariables in the program \\(P\\)’s entire source code.\nA key challenge in hybrid AARA is the interface between conventional AARA and\nBayesian resource analysis. Suppose conventional AARA generates a set \\(C\\) of\nlinear constraints over the variables \\(\\theta\\). Any solution to the linear\nconstraints \\(C\\) is a valid cost bound. Conventional AARA optimizes the\nvariables \\(\\theta\\) subject to the linear constraints \\(C\\). This\noptimization problem is solved by an LP solver. On the other hand, Bayesian\nresource analysis infers a posterior distribution of the variables \\(\\theta_e\n\\subseteq \\theta\\) by running a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm.\nThus, conventional AARA and Bayesian resource analysis both involve the\nvariables \\(\\theta_e\\) in common, but they each use different algorithms for\ninference. How do we design their interface?\nOne idea is to restrict the state space of the sampling algorithm to the\nfeasible region of the linear constraints \\(C\\). We first construct a\nprobabilistic model over all variables \\(\\theta \\supseteq \\theta_e\\), which\nrepresent resource annotations in the program \\(P\\)’s source code. We then run\na sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm over these variables, subject to\nthe linear constraints \\(C\\). Thanks to the constraints \\(C\\), any cost\nbound drawn from the posterior distribution is a valid cost bound according to\nconventional AARA.\nTo implement hybrid AARA, we rely on recent advances in the literature of\nsampling algorithms. In 2021, a C++ library\nvolesti started to support\nsampling from a user-specified probability distribution subject to arbitrary\nlinear constraints. This is the first (and so far, only) tool that supports such\nsampling. Popular programming languages for Bayesian inference, such as\nStan, only support box constraints (i.e., upper and\nlower bounds) on random variables, but not arbitrary linear constraints that may\ninvolve multiple variables.\nEvaluation\nWe ran Hybrid AARA on the linear-time selection algorithm. Inside the selection\nalgorithm’s source code, the code fragment partition x m, which partitions\nlist x around the median of medians m, is analyzed by data-driven analysis.\nThe rest of the source code is analyzed by static analysis. Figure 3 displays\nthe inference results.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Inference results of hybrid AARA for the linear-time selection\nalgorithm. Black dots are runtime cost measurements. The light-blue shade is the\n10-90th percentile range of the cost bounds sampled from the posterior\ndistribution, and the blue line is the median cost bound. The red line is the\ntrue cost bound.\n\n\nIn Figure 3, the 10-90th percentile ranges (light-blue shade) of inferred cost\nbounds now contain or lie above the ground truth (red line). This is a\nsignificant improvement over Bayesian resource analysis (Figure 2), where the\ninferred cost bounds are below the true worst-case bounds.\nMore generally, we have evaluated hybrid AARA on a suite of seven benchmarks:\nMapAppend, Concat, InsertionSort2, QuickSort, QuickSelection,\nMedianOfMedians (this is the linear-time selection algorithm we have seen in\nthis blog post), and ZAlgorithm. Conventional AARA fails in all benchmarks as\nthey each contain a code fragment that cannot be analyzed statically by\nconventional AARA. Further, in all benchmarks, hybrid AARA infers cost bounds\ncloser to the true worst-case cost bounds than purely data-driven resource\nanalysis. Thus, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of hybrid resource\nanalysis: hybrid analysis infers more accurate worst-case cost bounds than\npurely data-driven analysis, while overcoming the incompleteness of purely\nstatic analysis. The details of the evaluation can be found in out paper Robust\nResource Bounds with Static Analysis and Bayesian Inference.\nConclusion\nHybrid resource analysis combines purely static analysis, which offers soundness\nguarantees of worst-case cost bounds but is incomplete, and purely data-driven\nanalysis, which is not sound but can infer a cost bound for any program. By\ncombining these two complementary analysis techniques, hybrid resource analysis\nsuccessfully infers cost bounds that neither purely static analysis nor purely\ndata-driven analysis can infer. This is demonstrated by the experiment results\nof the linear-time selection algorithm.\nHybrid AARA has a limitation that its data-driven analysis only infers resource\nannotations, but not other quantities (e.g., depth of recursion). As a result,\nhybrid AARA cannot handle some programs such as bubble sort. In bubble sort,\nconventional AARA cannot infer the number of recursive calls, but it can still\ncorrectly infer a cost bound of each recursive call. Therefore, ideally, we\nwould like to infer (i) the number of recursive calls by data-driven analysis\nand (ii) the cost of each recursive call by conventional AARA. This requires a\ndifferent hybrid analysis technique from hybrid AARA presented in this blog\npost, and we plan to investigate it as future work.\nAcknowledgement: hybrid AARA is joint work with Feras\nSaad and Jan\nHoffmann. Our paper Robust Resource Bounds with\nStatic Analysis and Bayesian Inference is currently under review, and hopefully\nwe can share it soon.\nFurther reading: the original paper on\nAARA targets linear cost\nbounds. Subsequently, AARA has been extended to univariate polynomial cost\nbounds and multivariate\npolynomial cost bounds.\nResource-aware ML is an implementation for AARA for\nanalyzing OCaml programs. Papers on data-driven resource analysis include the\ntrend profiler, algorithmic\nprofiler, and input-sensitive\nprofiler. They are all\nconcerned with average-case cost bounds, rather than worst-case cost bounds as\nin this blog post. Also, these papers all use optimization instead of Bayesian\ninference.\n1\nIn contrast to static analysis, data-driven analysis\n(including Bayesian resource analysis) always requires the user’s domain\nknowledge to construct a statistical model. This dependency on domain\nknowledge is inherent in statistics: the inference result depends on our\nchoice of data-analysis methodologies (e.g., optimization or Bayesian\ninference), statistical models, and hyperparameters.\n\n2\nHere, by the lack of soundness guarantee, we mean that the cost\nbound inferred by data-driven analysis is not guaranteed to be a valid\nworst-case cost bound for all possible inputs to the program. Nonetheless,\ndata-driven analysis is sound with respect to the probabilistic model and\ndataset used, as long as we use a correct inference algorithm.\n\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/hybrid-resource-analysis/","title":"Integrating Static and Data-Driven Resource Analyses for

compilation.\nMLCEngine is a single engine to enable LLM deployment across both cloud and edge devices, with full support for OpenAI API.\nPerformance has been one of the key driving factors of our development.\nOver the past few months, we have been working hard to improve the inference performance of server settings.\nThis post shares our results and learnings through the process.\nSpecifically, we focus on the high-throughput low-latency LLM inference problem.\nIn this blogpost, we will introduce and discuss:\n\nLLM inference background and the high-throughput low-latency LLM inference problem.\nThroughput-latency tradeoff benchmark of state-of-the-art LLM engines.\nMLCEngine achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-latency inference

latency requirements.\nImpacts of speculative decoding.\nSpeculative decoding can reduce latency by more than 25% in low-latency LLM inference.\n\nBackground: LLM Inference\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as highly sophisticated transformer-based machine learning models that are capable of generating high-quality text.\nTrained with billions of parameters, LLMs power applications ranging from conversational AI to content creation, and can potentially change everyone’s life.\nLLM inference typically includes two main stages: the prefill phase and the decode phase.\nIn the prefill phase, the model processes the initial input text and generates a first output token.\nFollowing this, the decode phase begins, where tokens are generated one-by-one in an auto-regressive decoding manner,\nand each new token is generated based on the previously generated tokens.\nAn important component of an LLM inference engine is the KV (key-value) cache.\nDuring decoding, the model stores intermediate key/value data of all tokens in this cache.\nBy reusing these key/value data, the model can avoid redundant calculations\nand thereby significantly reduces computation during the decode phase.\nTensor parallelism is often employed to deploy a model on multiple GPUs.\nThis approach splits the model’s weights across all GPUs,\nallowing parts of each layer to run simultaneously on different devices.\nTensor parallelism distributes the computational load and memory requirements,\nmaking it possible to run LLM inference on larger models without overwhelming single GPUs.\nSpeculative decoding is an optimization technique aimed at speeding up the auto-regressive generation of tokens.\nBy predicting and generating multiple tokens at once rather than strictly one at a time,\nspeculative decoding reduces latency and accelerates inference.\nOur Focus: Low-Latency LLM Inference\nThis post specifically focuses on the high-throughput low-latency LLM inference problem,\nwhere we prioritize getting low latency, and want to achieve high throughput conditioned on the low latency goal.\nWhile many performance improvements focus on throughput-oriented settings\n(where LLM engines process very heavy workloads, and request preemption and fine-grained request scheduling are more involved),\nlatency has become increasingly important for LLM engines.\nWe are particularly interested in scenarios where each user can get more than 50 tok/sec, 100 tok/sec or even higher,\nwhile maintaining reasonable request concurrency (batch size) for higher throughput without request preemption (unlike throughput-oriented settings).\nAdditionally, we are interested in looking at the throughput-latency tradeoffs as we vary the request concurrency, providing users with more flexible choices in picking the setup that works best for them.\nIn the remainder of the post, we first evaluate the latency and throughput of MLCEngine on Llama3 models.\nWe will then move on to a deeper analysis of the impact of different inference settings,\nsuch as tensor parallelism and speculative decoding, on high-performance, low-latency inference.\nOur results on H100 show that MLCEngine achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-latency inference settings on multiple latency constraint thresholds.\nWe will also provide a characterization of different inference system setup tradeoffs for the low-latency inference scenario.\nBenchmark Setup\nThe evaluation in this blogpost is done with Llama3 8B fp16 and 70B fp8 on a node with NVIDIA H100 SXM GPUs.\nWe use the ShareGPT dataset to construct request inputs and set the output length.\nIn the evaluation, we fix the number of concurrent requests to be 1/4/8/10/16/20/30/64 and send 500 requests in total.\nWe measure the TPOT (time per output token, the average number of tokens received per second after the first token is received) of each request and the overall engine output token throughput.\nWe include more results and discussions in the appendix, for topics about the fixing of request rate, TTFT (time to first token),\n90th percentile performance, and other input/output lengths. Instructions for reproducing the benchmark results are also provided in the appendix.\nTo get a sense of how MLCEngine compares with current state-of-the-art solutions, we compared with SGLang (v0.3.1.post2) and vLLM (v0.6.1.post2).\nThe space of LLM inference is evolving fast so we also anticipate the frameworks to improve over time.\nWe will spend part of the blog discussing lessons learnt that could benefit the broader ML systems community.\nBenchmark Throughput and Latency Trade-Off\nWe begin with the basic results of the Llama3 8B fp16 model on 1 GPU and the 70B fp8 model on 4 GPUs with tensor parallelism.\nThe figures below show the TPOT (time per output token) and per-GPU output token throughput under different numbers of concurrent requests.\nWe normalize the throughput by the number of GPUs, as we can always add GPU replicas to scale the overall throughput.\nThese figures don’t include the additional optimizations (e.g., speculative decoding) that are discussed later,\nand all the data points are collected with the same API endpoint with no special configuration tuning.\n\n    \n    \n\nWe can clearly see the tradeoff between latency and output throughput from the figures.\nIn a throughput-oriented setting, we usually pay attention to the upper right side of the plots,\nas the request concurrency grows up, LLM engines can achieve higher throughput as concurrent requests are batched together for processing,\nin which case the latency of a single request may suffer from engine request scheduling such as preemption.\nWhen we have a low-latency goal (say we would like to have output tokens to be better than 100 tok/sec) in mind,\nhowever, we need to instead look at the upper left side of the plots that fit into the latency target.\nFor example, in order to maintain 100 tok/s latency for Llama3 8B, MLCEngine can maintain about 30 concurrent users,\nand get 3000 tok/s overall throughput.\nOverall, we find MLCEngine can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the low-latency inference settings and continue to be effective as we scale to larger workloads.\nIn the upcoming subsection, we will discuss the techniques behind the scheme.\nHow do we achieve low latency?\nThere are various factors contributing to the low latency of MLCEngine, and we are happy to share the lessons we’ve learnt with the community.\nFast decode attention.\nThe computation time proportion of attention in the LLM inference decoding stage varies depending on the context length,\nfrom less than 20% in short contexts of about 100 tokens to more than 50% in long contexts of thousands of tokens.\nMLC integrates the state-of-the-art attention library FlashInfer for serving to reduce the attention overhead.\nCompiler-driven kernel generation and dispatch.\nAs a compiler-based solution, MLCEngine supports leveraging GPU kernels from different sources.\nFor example, we dispatch GeMM (General Matrix Multiply) operators to cuBLAS or CUTLASS kernels for large request concurrency,\nwhile using the compiler-generated efficient GeMV kernels (which is 5-10x faster then the cuBLAS kernel)\nfor the request concurrency of 1 and low request concurrency.\nDynamic shape-aware memory planning and CUDA Graph.\nMLC supports a dynamic shape-aware memory planning compiler pass that can help statically allocate the required GPU memory\nand thus avoid any runtime memory allocation/deallocation during inference.\nWe have CUDA Graph rewrite compiler pass that further allows us to leverage CUDA Graph\nand reduce GPU kernel launch overhead.\nWe find that CUDA Graph is especially important for multi-GPU use cases to reduce the variability,\nand can contribute to up to 10% of latency reduction in multi-GPU inference.\nCPU overhead reduction.\nMLC employs lots of effort to reduce the CPU overhead between consecutive rounds of decoding.\nImportantly, we drive the engine loop with a standalone thread and leave all other frontend request\nprocesses (e.g., tokenizer encode/decode, asynchronous HTTP receive/send, etc.) on the other thread.\nThis architecture allows for the asynchronous processing of request output and engine GPU computation.\nTogether with other CPU-side optimizations, the CPU overhead counts towards about 3% of batch decoding time.\nImpacts of Tensor Parallelism\nData parallelism and tensor parallelism are two common approaches to scale LLM inference to more GPUs.\nData parallelism duplicates the model on the extra set of GPUs, doubles the overall system throughput, and keeps the output latency unchanged.\nWhile tensor parallelism employs the extra GPUs to collectively serve the model, reduces serving latency but sacrifices some throughput.\nTo understand the impacts of tensor parallelism in different scenarios, we evaluate MLCEngine in different TP settings.\nThe y-axis is normalized by the number of GPUs so we can effectively compare the throughput latency tradeoff of higher TP setting and lower TP setting.\nFigures below show the evaluation results of Llama3 8B fp16 on 1/2 GPUs and Llama3 70B fp8 on 4/8 GPUs.\n\n    \n    \n\nIn both figures, we can see a crossover point between the curves of two TP settings.\nThis means that the configuration choice varies across our latency goals, because we always\nprefer a higher throughput as long as the fixed latency goal is satisfied.\nAccording to the figures, we would want to keep higher TP to enable low-latency serving and rely on\ndata parallelism (and a smaller TP number) when the task is not as latency-sensitive.\nFor the Llama3 8B case, if we would like to ensure the 100 tok/sec latency goal,\nwe can find that the 30 request concurrency point of TP=1 is slightly higher than the concurrency of 64 under TP=2.\nHowever, as we aim for even lower latency, TP=2 becomes more preferable.\nFor example, if we further pick the latency threshold to TPOT of 7ms (equivalent to the output speed of 143 tok/s),\nfor TP=2 we can pick request concurrency 30, but for TP=1 we can only pick the request concurrency 8, with 45% lower output throughput.\nFor Llama3 70B fp8, the crossover point of TP=4 and TP=8 is different.\nThis study shows a complicated interaction when we pick tensor parallelism versus data parallelism with different latency and throughput targets,\nand we need to systematically look at the latency throughput tradeoff when deciding the best deployment configuration.\nImpacts of Speculative Decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a very useful technique in LLM inference to reduce the overall latency.\nSpeculative decoding leverages a smaller draft model (or combining draft proposal head into the model) to propose\nmultiple tokens and makes the target model verify a whole draft one at a time, to benefit from the batching effects of LLM inference.\nOne can think of speculative decoding as an approach to increase the effective batch size per concurrent user.\nMost of the speculative decoding study so far has been focused on processing a single sequence,\nwhile concurrency is still important in server settings as we would want to get reasonable throughput.\nWe combine speculative decoding with the high-performance serving solution and study the impact of speculative decoding\nthrough the Llama3 70B fp8 speculative decoding results with the draft model Llama3 8B fp8 and draft\nlength 3 (so that the effective length is 4 per verification step) for TP=4 and TP=8, and compare the results with normal batch decoding.\n\n    \n    \n\nAs shown in the figures above, speculative decoding consistently brings lower latency when we look at low latency settings,\nespecially when we want the output speed to go beyond 70 tok/s.\nIn the current benchmarking scenario, TP=4 offers better throughput tradeoffs per GPU, while TP=8 offers the lowest latency possible.\nAs the request concurrency grows larger, the normal batch decoding gradually shifts from memory bound to compute bound, marginalizing the benefit of speculative decoding.\nIt is worth noting that the benefit of speculative decoding also depends on the acceptance rate of speculation, which may vary across different datasets.\nEfficient Speculative Decoding System with Continuous Batching.\nIt is worthwhile noting that we need to deal with compound system complexity when combining speculative decoding together with continuous batching.\nThe LLM engine overhead reduction becomes extremely important as the draft model is still running in a tight loop and can take a strong hit from the engine overhead.\nWe also need to carefully manage the draft logits and avoid dynamic memory allocation when possible.\nFinally, we need to build a specialized kernel to verify all the batched proposals at once without turning back to the CPU.\nDiscussion and Future Opportunities\nIn this blogpost, we study the tradeoffs of LLM inference in high-throughput low-latency scenarios.\nIt is important to note that we did not yet cover other advanced features in MLCEngine,\nsuch as prefix caching (affecting common system prompts), structured constraint overhead (for JSON schema generation),\nand advanced speculation methods such as Eagle and Medusa.\nThe compounding effects of these elements can depend on the scenarios we are looking at as well as the effectiveness of the corresponding system solutions.\nWe will leave these studies in future posts in the MLC community.\nAppendix\nFixing the request rate\nThe evaluation so far focuses on fixing the request concurrency,\nwhich precisely reveals the underlying LLM engine performance on various workload heaviness.\nFixing the request rate is another common benchmark workload.\nWhen running LLM engines with a fixed request rate, the underlying batch size of the engines varies over time.\nBenchmarking with fixed request rates provides more comprehensive results compared to fixing request concurrency, which is more granular.\nThe figures below show the results under different fixed request rates (1/2/4/8/16), where MLCEngine delivers the state-of-the-art aligned latency.\n\n    \n    \n\nTime to first token\nTTFT (time to first token) is an important metric in LLM inference.\nIt refers to the time in seconds between sending a request to the API and receiving the first token of the response.\nUsually, the TTFT metric reveals the efficiency of request scheduling and input prefilling of an LLM engine.\nThe figures below show the measured average TTFT under different request concurrency for the Llama3 8B fp16 and 70B fp8 models.\nMLCEngine has comparable aligned TTFT in general across various request concurrency.\n\n    \n    \n\n90th percentile performance\nThe tail performance (TPOT, TTFT) is also an important metric that people care about, in addition to the average performance.\nThe two figures below show the p90 TPOT and TTFT results for Llama3 70B fp8 under different request concurrency.\n\n    \n    \n\nThe two figures below show the p90 TPOT and TTFT under different fixed request rates.\n\n    \n    \n\nDifferent input/output lengths\nIn addition to reusing the input and output lengths from the ShareGPT dataset,\nwe also evaluate LLM engines with other fixed input/output lengths.\nThe two figures below show the TPOT and TTFT results when each request has a fixed input length of 100 and an output length of 500 for Llama3 70B fp8.\n\n    \n    \n\nThe two figures below show the results for the fixed input length of 1000 and output length of 500.\n\n    \n

MLCEngine"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/mariposa/":{"body":"Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are powerful tools\nthat answer logical and mathematical questions.\nAs an example, let’s say I want to know whether there exists integers\n\\(a, b, c\\) such that \\(3a^{2} -2ab -b^2c = 7\\).\nTo ask an SMT solver, I need to write an SMT query, which is in a standardized format for expressing logical problems. In the SMT query below, the declare-fun command creates a variable (i.e., a\nfunction with no argument), the assert command states the equation\nas a constraint. More generally, an SMT query may contain\nmultiple assertions, and the check-sat command checks if\nthe query context, i.e., the conjunction of the\nassertions, is satisfiable.\n\n\nThe possible answers from the SMT solver can be “Yes”\n(satisfiable), “No” (unsatisfiable) or “I don’t know”\n(unknown). Suppose the solver responds with “Yes”\n(satisfiable) in this case. This is good, because the\nquestion is not so straightforward to me at least, and the\nsolver gives a definitive answer. What’s more, the solver\nprovides fairly high assurance about its responses, which\nare justified by precise mathematical reasoning. For\nthis example, the solver can also provide a solution, a = 1, b = 2, c = -2, which serves as a checkable witness to\nthe “Yes” answer.\nHowever, the solver is not perfect, because even a seemingly\nbenign change to a query can\ntrip up the SMT solver, causing it to give up. Suppose that\nI slightly tweak the formula and ask again:\n\n\nThis time, the following may happen: the solver gives up,\nsaying “I don’t know” to this new query. Understandably,\nthis may seem puzzling. As you might have noticed, the two\nqueries are essentially the same, just with different\nvariable names.\nIs it even a legitimate move for it to give up? Why would the solver give different responses?\nBefore you get mad at the solver (this is a made-up example\nBTW), let me explain why it can unexpectedly fail with a\nseemingly innocuous query change. As mentioned earlier, the\nSMT solver sticks to precise mathematical reasoning.\nTherefore, if a best-effort try doesn’t work out, the solver\nis allowed to give up, instead of giving bogus answers.\nMoreover, the solver heuristics may not be robust against\nsuperficial modifications to the input, leading to\nconfusing responses on similar inquiries.\n\n\nWhat we have observed in this example is the phenomenon of\nSMT instability, where trivial changes to the input\nquery may incur large performance variations (or even\ndifferent responses) from the solver. While there are many\napplications of the SMT solver, in this blog post, I will focus\non instability in SMT-based program verification, where\nwe ask the solver to prove programs correct. More\nconcretely, instability manifests as a butterfly effect:\neven tiny, superficial changes in the program may lead to\nnoticeable change in proof performance and even spurious\nverification failures.\n\nInstability in SMT-based Program Verification\nPlease allow me to briefly explain why program verification\nis useful, how SMT solvers can help with verification, and\nwhy instability comes up as a concern. If you are already\nfamiliar with the background topic, please feel free to skip\nthis section.\nAs programmers, we often make informal claims about our\nsoftware. For example, I might say that a filesystem is\ncrash-safe or an encryption software is secure, etc. However, as\nmany of us can testify, these claims might be\nunfounded or even straight-up wrong. Sometimes, the cost of software failure can be catastrophic (e.g., consider spacecrafts or medical devices).\nFortunately, formal\nverification offers a path to move beyond informal claims and avoid such\ndisasters.\nFormal verification uses proofs to show that the code meets\nits specification. In comparison to testing, formal\nverification offers a higher level of assurance, since it\nreasons about the program’s behavior for all possible\ninputs, not just the ones in the test cases. In a\nmore-or-less standard\nalgorithm,\nprogram properties can be encoded as logical statements,\noften called the verification conditions (VCs). Essentially, the\ntask of formal verification is to prove that the VCs hold.\nIn SMT-based program verification, the solver takes as input\nthe VCs and search for proofs. As you might have gathered\nfrom the previous example, the SMT solver can reason about\npretty complex logical statements. In this way, the solver\nenables a high degree of automation, allowing the developer\nto skip manual and tedious proof steps. This methodology has\nthus made verification of complex software systems a\nreality.\nHowever, SMT-based automation also introduces the problem of\ninstability. Verified software, similar to regular software,\nhas an iterative development process. As the developers make\nincremental changes to the code, corresponding queries also\nchange constantly. Even seemingly trivial changes, such as\nrenaming a variable would create a different query. As we\nhave discussed, the solver may not respond consistently to\nthese changes, leading to confusing verification results and\nfrustrated developers.\nDetecting Instability with Mariposa\nNow that we have a basic understanding of instability, let’s\ntry to quantify it more systematically. I will\nintroduce the methodology used in Mariposa, a tool that we\nhave built to measure and detect instability. In this blog post, I will\nstick to the key intuitions and elide the details. For a\nmore thorough discussion, I encourage you to check out our\npaper. At a high level, given an original query \\( q \\) and\nan SMT solver \\( s \\), Mariposa answers the question:\n\nIs the query-solver pair \\((q, s)\\) stable?\n\n\nIntuitively, instability means that \\( s\n\\) experiences a mix of successes and failures when we apply seemingly irrelevant mutations to\n\\( q \\). Mariposa detects instability by generating a set\nof mutated queries and evaluating the performance of \\( s\n\\) on each mutant. In this section, I will explain what\nmutations are used, and how Mariposa decides the stability\nstatus of the query-solver pair.\nWhat Mutations to Use?\nIn Mariposa, a mutation method needs to preserve not only\nthe semantic meaning but also the syntactic structures of a\nquery. More precisely, the original query \\( q \\) and its\nmutant \\( q’ \\) need to be both semantically equivalent\nand syntactically isomorphic.\n\n\n\nSemantic Equivalence. \\( q \\) and \\( q’ \\) are semantically equivalent\nwhen there is a bijection between the set of proofs for \\( q \\)\nand those for \\( q’ \\) . In other words, a proof of \\( q \\) can be\ntransformed into a proof of \\( q’ \\) , and vice versa.\n\n\nSyntactic Isomorphism. \\( q \\) and \\( q’ \\)  are\nsyntactically isomorphic if there exists a bijection between\nthe symbols (e.g., variables) and commands (e.g.,\nassert). In other words, each symbol or command in \\( q \\)  has\na counterpart in \\( q’ \\), and vice versa.\n\n\nFor our concrete experiments, we are interested in mutations\nthat also correspond to common development practices.\nSpecifically, we consider the following three mutation\nmethods:\n\n\nAssertion Shuffling. Reordering of source-level lemmas\nor methods is a common practice when developing verified\nsoftware. Such reordering roughly corresponds to shuffling\nthe commands in the query. Since an SMT query is a\nconjunction of assertions, the assertion order does not\nimpact query semantics. Further, shuffling the assertions\nguarantees syntactic isomorphism.\n\n\nSymbol Renaming. It is common to rename source-level\nmethods, types, or variables, which roughly corresponds to\nrenaming the symbols in the SMT queries. As long as the\nsymbol names are used consistently, Renaming preserves\nsemantic equivalence and syntactic isomorphism.\n\n\nRandomness Reseeding. SMT solvers optionally take as\ninput a random seed, which is used in some of their\nnon-deterministic choices. Changing the seed has no effect\non the query’s semantics but is known to affect the solver’s\nperformance. While technically not a mutation, reseeding has\nbeen used as a proxy for measuring instability, which is why\nwe have included it here.\n\n\n\nAs an example, suppose we have a query \\( q \\) with \\(\n100 \\) assertions. If we exhaustively apply shuffling to\n\\( q \\), we obtain a set of mutated queries, with \\(100!\n\\approx 9 \\times 10^{157}\\) permutations of \\( q \\).\nIs it Stable or Not?\nWhether a query-solver pair \\( (q, s) \\) is stable or not\ndepends on how the mutants perform. A natural measure is the\nMutant Success Rate, i.e., the percentage of \\( q\\)’s\nmutants that are verified by \\( s \\). Intuitively, the\nsuccess rate, denoted by \\(r\\), reflects performance\nconsistency. A low \\(r\\) indicates consistently poor\nresults; a high \\(r\\) indicates consistently good results;\nand a moderate \\(r\\) indicates inconsistent results, i.e.,\ninstability.\nMariposa thus introduces four stability categories based on \\(r\\): unsolvable, unstable, stable, and inconclusive.\nThe scheme includes two additional parameters:\n\\(r_{solvable}\\) and \\(r_{stable}\\), corresponding to\nthe lower and upper range for unstable queries. In our\nconcrete experiments, we set \\(r_{solvable} = 5\\% \\) and\n\\(r_{stable} = 95\\%\\).\n\nThe inconclusive category is needed as a result of\nstatistical tests. Specifically, it is often infeasible to\nenumerate all the mutants of a query and obtain the true\nsuccess rate. (Think about the \\(100!\\) mutants or more!)\nTherefore, Mariposa uses random sampling to estimate the\nsuccess rate. When the estimated success rate based on the\nsampled mutants is close to the boundaries, the statistical\ntest may not result in enough confidence to place \\( (q, s)\n\\) in any of the previous three categories, yielding an\ninconclusive result.\n\n\n\nMeasuring Instability in the Wild\nSo far we have discussed Mariposa’s methodology to detect\nand quantify instability. How much instability is there in\npractice? Let me share some experimental results from\nexisting program verification projects.\nProjects and Queries\nThe table below lists the projects we experimented.\nGenerally speaking: (1) These are all verified system\nsoftware such as storage systems, boot loaders, and\nhypervisors. (2) They all involve non-trivial engineering\neffort, creating a considerable number of SMT queries. (3)\nThey are all published at top venues, with source code and\nverification artifacts available online.\nProject NameSource Line CountQuery CountArtifact Solver\nKomodo\\(_D \\) (SOSP’17)26K2,054Z3 4.5.0\nKomodo\\(_S \\) (SOSP’19)4K773Z3 4.2.2\nVeriBetrKV\\(_D \\) (OSDI’20)44K5,325Z3 4.6.0\nVeriBetrKV\\(_L \\) (OOPSLA’22)49K5,600Z3 4.8.5\nDice\\(_F^⋆\\) (USENIX’21)25K1,536Z3 4.8.5\nvWasm\\(_F \\) (USENIX’22)15K1,755Z3 4.8.5\n\n\nHow Much Instability?\nFor our experiments, we focus on the Z3 SMT solver, with\nwhich the projects were developed. We are interested in both\nthe current and historical status of SMT stability.\nTherefore, in addition to the latest Z3 solver (version\n4.12.1, as of the work), we include seven legacy versions of\nZ3, with the earliest released in\n2015. In particular, for each project we include its\nartifact solver, which is the version used in the project’s\nartifact.\nWe run each project-solver pair through Mariposa. For each\noriginal query in a project, Mariposa outputs a stability\ncategory. Therefore, each project-solver pair is associated with\na breakdown of different stability categories, plotted as\nstacked bars in In Figure 1. Focusing on Z3 4.12.1 (the right-most\ngroup), the unstable proportion is the highest in\nKomodo\\(_D \\) (\\( 5.0\\% \\)), and \\(2.6\\%\\) across all queries. This\nmight not seem like a significant number, but think of the\na regular software project’s continuous integration (CI)   where \\(\\sim 2\\%\\) of the test cases may fail\nrandomly: it would be a nightmare! Nevertheless, developers\nhave to bear with such burden in SMT-based verification.\n\n\nFigure 1: Overall Stability Status. From bottom to top, each stacked bar shows the proportions of unsolvable (lightly shaded), unstable\n(deeply shaded), and inconclusive (uncolored) queries. The remaining portion of the queries (stacking each bar to 100%), not shown, are\nstable. The solver version used for each project’s artifact is marked with a star (⋆). \n\nNow that we know instability is not a rare occurrence, the\nnext question is: what gives? Well, first off, instability\nis a property that is jointly determined by the solver and\nthe query. Therefore, the causes can roughly be categorized\nas solver-related and query-related. Of course, I cannot\npossibly be exhaustive here, so let me discuss the\nsignificant ones we have found for each side.\n\n“Debugging” the Solver\n\nAs you might have noticed already, in Figure 1, there is a\n“gap” between Z3 4.8.5 and 4.8.8, where several projects\nsuffer from noticeably more instability in the newer\nsolver. In other words, certain queries used to be stable,\nbut somehow become unstable with the solver upgrade. Since\nthe query sets did not change, solver change is responsible for the regression.\nWe perform further experiments to narrow down the Z3 git\ncommits that may have been the problem. In the six\nexperiment projects, \\(285\\) queries are stable under Z3\n4.8.5 but unstable under Z3 4.8.8. For each query in this\nset, we run git bisect (which calls Mariposa) to find the\ncommit to blame, i.e., where the query first becomes\nunstable.\nThere is a total of \\(1,453\\) commits between the two versions,\namong which we identify two most impactful commits. Out of\nthe \\(285\\) regressed queries, \\(115 (40\\%)\\) are blamed on commit 5177cc4.\nAnother \\(77 (27\\%) \\)of the queries are blamed on 1e770af. The\nremaining queries are dispersed across the other commits.\nThe two commits are small and localized: 5177cc4 has \\( 2\n\\) changed files with \\( 8 \\) additions and \\( 2 \\)\ndeletions; 1e770af has only \\( 1 \\) changed file with\n\\( 18 \\) additions and \\( 3 \\) deletions. Both commits\nare related to the order of disjunctions in a query’s\nconjunctive normal form.\n1e770af, the earlier of the two, sorts the disjunctions,\nwhile 5177cc4 adds a new term ordering, updating the\nsorted disjunction order. Similar to\nconjunction order, disjunction order does not affect the\nsemantics, but interacts with other solver heuristics. Therefore,\nthe change of disjunction order can be thought of as “internal mutations”\nto the query, exposing more instability.\n\n“Debugging” the Query\nThe discussion so far is condensed from our work on\nMariposa. However, we have yet to cover the query side of\nthe problem. To that end, let me share some results in our\nfollow-up work on query context. As it turns out, the\nqueries we have studied often contain a large amount of\nirrelevant information (assertions). However, the solver may\nnot need all of the context to find a proof. In fact, the\npresence of irrelevant information can cause “confusion” to\nthe solver, leading to instability.\n\nMost of the Context is Irrelevant\nOur experiments in this section analyze each query’s\ncore. Recall that an SMT query is a\nconjunction of assertions. Upon verification success, the\nsolver can report a core, which is the subset\nof the original assertions constructing the proof.\nTherefore, this “slimmed-down” version of the query is an\noracle of relevant assertions, and what is excluded from\nit can be considered irrelevant.\nAfter acquiring a core, we compare its context to the\noriginal query. Using the assertion count as a proxy for the\n“size” of the context, we examine the Relevance Ratio: \\(\n\\frac{\\# \\text{core\\ assertions}}{\\# \\text{original\\ assertions}} \\times 100\\% \\). Since a core is a\nsubset of the original query, the lower this ratio is, the\nless context remains, and the more irrelevant context the\noriginal query has.\n\nFigure 2:  Query Relevance Ratios. More to the left means more irrelevant contexts. Typically, the vast majority of an original query context is irrelevant. \nFigure 2 shows the CDFs of the relevance ratios for\ndifferent projects. For example, on the left side lies the\nline for Dice\\(_F^⋆\\). The median relevance ratio is \\(\n0.06\\% \\), meaning that for a typical query in the\nproject, only \\( 0.06\\% \\) of the context is relevant.\nPlease note that I have excluded Komodo\\(_S\\) from the\nexperiment, as its queries each contains only a single\nassertion due to special encoding rules. Nevertheless, among\nthe remaining projects, typically \\( 96.23\\% – 99.94\\%\n\\) of the context is irrelevant.\n\nIrrelevant Context Harms Stability\nConsidering the significant amount of irrelevant context, we\nfurther analyze how that impacts stability, by comparing the\noriginal queries and their core counterparts. Given an\noriginal query \\(q\\) and its core \\(q_c\\), we introduce\nthe following metrics among the possible stability status\ntransitions.\n\nCore Preservation: given that \\( q \\) is stable, the probability that \\( q_c \\) remains stable.\nCore Mitigation: given that  \\( q \\)  is unstable, the\nprobability that  \\( q_c \\) becomes stable.\n\nWe use the Mariposa tool with Z3 version 4.12.5 in this\nexperiment.

This innovation, introduced by blockchain technology, enables value transfer between parties without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks.\nFast forward to 2015, the blockchain landscape evolved further, giving rise to decentralized finance (DeFi). This advancement allowed for a more complex financial ecosystem where various assets could be exchanged, used as collateral, and borrowed—all without centralized authorities. As the DeFi world flourished, new profit-making opportunities emerged, with one of the most intriguing being Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). In 2021, MEV generated an impressive $540M in profits over 32 months.\nMEV represents a unique form of potential profit available to a specific group within blockchain networks. In Proof of Work systems, this group consists of miners, while in Proof of Stake systems, they’re known as block proposers. These participants have privileged access to unconfirmed transactions, allowing them to potentially extract risk-free profits.\nThis blog will explore the fascinating world of MEV through the following sections:\n\nBlockchain Fundamentals: We’ll start with a high-level, intuitive explanation of blockchain technology, providing the necessary context for understanding MEV.\nMEV in Action: We’ll examine several common MEV strategies, offering concrete examples of how these profits are harvested in practice.\nDeep Dive: Ethereum Consensus Mechanism: We’ll focus on the Ethereum ecosystem post-transition to Proof of Stake, explaining why MEV opportunities are primarily accessible to block proposers in this context.\nThe MEV Dilemma: Finally, we’ll discuss the broader implications of MEV activities, including potential problems they pose for blockchain networks and current solutions.\n\nWhat is a blockchain\nA blockchain is a public ledger, similar to a digital notebook, that keeps track of transactions (e.g., sending money to someone). Imagine each page of the notebook is a block, and each block lists a bunch of these trades. Once a page is full, it gets added to the notebook, linking it to the previous page. This linking creates a chain of pages, or blocks, hence the name “blockchain.”\nThis public ledger is stored on multiple computers called “nodes,” which form a blockchain network. These nodes communicate with each other to maintain the integrity and consistency of the ledger. Figure 1 is an illustration of a blockchain network with four nodes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Demonstrating a blockchain network with four nodes. Each node maintains an identical copy of the ledger, which is organized into a series of interconnected blocks. The ledger is organized by blocks. Nodes also talk to each other peer-to-peer. \n\n\nAnyone can become a node, meaning they would have a full copy of the blockchain. To add a new transaction, you only need to interact with one node to make your transaction public in the blockchain network. The nodes then work together to group transactions into blocks and add them to the blockchain.\nWith this public ledger and cryptographic tools, values like Bitcoin(BTC), Ether(ETH), and USD Coin(USDC) can be recorded and owned. Additionally, some blockchains, like Ethereum, have the capability of running smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that automatically enforce and execute the code. These smart contracts operate on a Turing-complete machine, meaning they can perform any computation given enough resources. This allows blockchains to support complex financial services, such as exchanges, options, and lending, directly on the network.\nTo put it simply, think of a blockchain as a secure, decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This ledger is visible to everyone and can’t be easily changed.\nCommon MEV Examples\nNumerous MEV opportunities abound within finance services (called Decentralized Finance protocols on the blockchain) mentioned above, particularly exchanges and lending platforms. MEV refers to the profit made by reordering, including, or excluding transactions when they are added to a block on the blockchain.\nLet’s use a simplified model to help understand. Assume that there are only two players in the MEV ecosystem: ordinary users and MEV searchers. Ordinary users like you and me perform regular transactions, such as buying or selling cryptocurrencies. MEV searchers, on the other hand, are specialized actors who try to exploit the way transactions are ordered in a block to make a profit. These searchers can see ordinary users’ transactions before they are included in blocks.\nFor example, an ordinary user wants to buy a cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange. When they submit their transaction, it doesn’t get processed immediately; instead, it waits in a queue called the “mempool,” as shown in Figure 2. Each node’s mempool may differ because of network delays, and nodes could be connected to different ordinary users.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Demonstrating a blockchain network with four nodes. Each node maintains an independent local mempool with unconfirmed transactions.  \n\n\nMEV searchers can monitor this mempool and see the transaction. If they notice an opportunity to profit by placing their own transaction before or after the user’s transaction, they will do so. This could involve placing a transaction just before the user’s transaction (to benefit from the price increase the user’s transaction will cause) and/or placing a transaction immediately after the user’s transaction (to benefit from the price increase the user’s transaction has caused already). Details are explained below.\nArbitrage\nThe first kind of MEV opportunities we introduce is arbitrage. Arbitrage happens in Decentralized exchanges (DEX) platforms when MEV searchers make a buying and a selling transactions right after an ordinary user’s transaction.\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) allow users to exchange between two kinds of tokens (e.g., ETH and USDC). However, if two exchanges are supporting the same pair of tokens and offer different prices, there are profits.\nFor example, the price for USDC/ETH is 1000 in both DEX A and Dex B. Right after an ordinary user exchanges in Dex B, call it \\(T_o\\), the price for USDC/ETH becomes 900 in Dex B. A searcher could\n\nPut a USDC to ETH transaction \\(T_b\\) in DEX B: selling 900 USDC and get 1 ETH\nPut a ETH to USDC transaction \\(T_a\\) in DEX A: selling 1 ETH and get 1000 USDC\n\n\\(T_b\\) and \\(T_a\\) together would result in a 100 USDC net income. This example is demonstrated in Figure 3 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. An arbitrage example with an MEV searcher making profits from price differences in two exchanges caused by an ordinary user's transaction.  \n\n\nFor an arbitrage to succeed, there’re two conditions, the first is that a price difference occurs in the DEX after someone exchanges, the second is that MEV searcher’s transactions are right after the ordinary user’s. The first condition is guaranteed because DEXs are self-executing programs that automatically enforce and execute the code, which means that everyone could calculate the price after the ordinary user’s transaction. The second condition is met if the MEV searcher is in charge of ordering transactions in a block.\nBecause searchers can see ordinary users’ transactions before they are included in blocks, when a searcher sees \\(T_o\\) in the ‘mempool’, they will calculate the price in DEX B. If arbitrage is profitable, the searcher will generate \\(T_b\\) and \\(T_a\\) and create a block with transactions in the order \\((T_o,T_b,T_a,…)\\) to secure their profit.\nLiquidation\nLending Protocols, like Aave, allow a user to collateralize assets of one type and borrow assets of another. If one wants to exchange from one asset to another without suffering from the price change in DEX, they may choose lending protocols. For example, Alice may use 1500 USDC as collateral, put that in a lending protocol, and borrow 1 ETH.\nHowever, the prices of cryptocurrencies change all the time. When Alice (an ordinary user) initially stakes their USDC, 1 ETH may only be worth 1000 USDC. As the price of ETH increases, 1500 USDC may be worth less than 1 ETH. In this case, to avoid bad debt, the protocol will sell Alice’s collateral before the price of ETH reaches 1500 USDC. The selling point is the liquidation threshold, which is the percentage of the total value of debt borrowed. Selling/buying someone’s collateral to avoid bad debt is called liquidation. For Aave specifically, the protocol will sell Alice’s collateral when the price of ETH reaches 1237.5, corresponding to a liquidation threshold of 82.5%.\nIn this case, any buyer (MEV searcher) buying 1500 USDC with 1 ETH when the market price of ETH is only 1237.5 USDC has a net profit of 262.5 USDC. This 262.5 USDC is a risk-free profit because the buyer could buy 1500 USDC with 1 ETH and sell that 1 ETH in the same transaction using smart contracts.\nSandwich Trading\nAnother well-known MEV opportunity is sandwich trading. As we mentioned above, when we exchange from one asset to another in DEX, the price of the assets depends on the number of assets in the liquidity pool. For example, in Figure 4.a, Alice (an ordinary user) would like to trade 1 ETH to USDC. When Alice signs the transaction, the DEX has 100 ETH and 100,000 USDC; she would expect 990 USDC if the DEX is a constant product market maker, meaning that the product of two assets always stays the same.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.a An example of an ordinary transaction exchanging from 1 ETH to 990 USDC  \n\n\nHowever, as shown in Figure 4.b, if Bob sells 1 ETH before Alice, the liquidity pool would have 99,010 USDC and 101 ETH, and by the time Alice sells her 1 ETH, she could only receive 971 USDC. Alice cannot be sure when her transaction will be included in a block. There might be pending transactions in the mempool, or Bob may simply pay a higher priority fee.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.b An example of Alice's transaction exchanging from 1 ETH to 971 USDC only if another ordinary user's transaction is before Alice in the same block. \n\n\nAlice typically specifies the minimum price she is willing to accept, such as “I want to receive at least 950 USDC for my 1 ETH!” She avoids setting a high minimum price like “I want to receive at least 1000 (or higher) USDC for my 1 ETH!” to prevent potential delays or transaction failures due to infeasible prices. The former ensures a smoother transaction process, while the latter could lead to frustration.\nIf Alice sets her minimum acceptable price at 971 USDC for her 1 ETH, Bob could exploit this as an MEV searcher. In Figure 4.c, by selling ETH before Alice, Bob could drive the price down to Alice’s minimum and then buy ETH after Alice’s transaction. The example below shows a net profit of 0.02 ETH from a 1 ETH transaction at a price of 1000 USDC/ETH. Once again, this is a risk-free profit, as all three transactions could occur in a single block, and if any one of them fails, all three transactions are reverted.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.c An example of Alice's transaction exchanging from 1 ETH to 971 USDC being sandwiched by Bob, who sells before Alice and buys immediately after to make a net profit of 0.02 ETH.\n\n\nEthereum Consensus Mechanism\nIn the previous section, we considered a simple model with only two players: ordinary users and MEV searchers. Now, we will introduce another player: proposers/miners.\nBefore 2022, Ethereum is using a proof of work consensus mechanism, the same as Bitcoin. Ethereum switched to a much more energy efficient consensus mechanism: Proof of Stake in 2022. The main idea related to MEV stays the same in both consensus mechanims.\nIn a blockchain system like Ethereum, the process begins when users (both ordinary users and MEV searchers) create and send transactions (actions they want to perform, like buying or selling tokens) to proposers/miners. When sending a transaction to proposers/miners, users specify the fees they’re willing to pay for block inclusion. Part of the fee goes to the Ethereum protocol and is destroyed; the rest goes to proposers.\nThese proposers collect a batch of transactions, organize them into a group called a block, and add this block to the blockchain. Once the block is added, the transactions within it are considered confirmed, meaning they are officially recorded and cannot be easily altered.\nProposers have significant control over which transactions to include in each block and the order in which they appear. This power allows them to potentially maximize their profits by prioritizing transactions in ways that are financially advantageous to them. For instance, they might choose to include transactions that offer higher transaction fees first.\nTo become a miner, one needs to start “mining” on your computer by running a program. To become a proposer, one needs to stake 32ETH to become a validator and every slot (12 seconds), a proposer is selected randomly among all validators by the Ethereum protocol.\nPriority Gas Auction\nIn many cases, more than one MEV searcher may find the same MEV opportunities and compete for the block inclusion because only the first searcher could make profits from the same MEV opportunity; for example, if the liquidation has happened, the second searcher’s attempt will fail as the protocol has nothing to sell.\nAs we mentioned above, when miners/proposers bundle transactions into a block, they pick the transactions with the highest priority fee to maximize their profit.\nMEV searchers, in this case, would run auctions publicly in the network for miners to include their transactions. For example, if searchers A and B found the same MEV opportunity with 1 ETH profit. A and B would each broadcast a series of transactions with the same content but an incremental gas fee. We call these transactions “bids” resembling bids in auctions. This auction process is termed priority gas auction (PGA). PGA was brought up initially before 2022 thus we’re using miners when explaining PGA.\nWe use an example from Flash Boy 2.0 to illustrate this. Figure 4 below shows two searchers, 0x6B…6542 and 0xb8…7a3f, bidding for the arbitrage opportunity. We use triangles to represent a series of bids with different gas fees placed by 0x6B…6542 and circles for 0xb8…7a3f. The auction lasted 14 seconds, with both searchers gradually increasing the bid from \\(25\\) gwei to roughly \\(8000\\) gwei. The green star and red rectangular are the two transactions included into the block.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Image from Flash Boy 2.0 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234), demonstrating two MEV searchers bidding for the same MEV opportunity. \n\n\nPGA resembles a first-price-all-pay auction since when two players compete for the same MEV opportunities, and the second player’s transactions fail, they still need to pay a percentage of the gas fee for block inclusion.\nIn our example, the auction winner and loser are the two transactions with \\(134\\)  and \\(133\\) gwei, respectively. Due to network delay, searchers were still updating gas fees after miners had included the transactions.\nProblems caused by MEV and Current Solutions\nIndeed, not all MEV transactions involve attacks. Even for sandwich trading, where a 2% loss occurs in each transaction, it can still be advantageous compared to traditional financial systems, where banks often charge between 0.5% to 5%. However, to extract past MEV, miners/proposers may re-org the chain history. This is an existential threat to Ethereum’s consensus security. Less severely, with searchers competing for block space in the open network, Ethereum suffers network congestion and chain congestion.\nProblems: Network Congestion, Chain Congestion, and Time-bandit attack\nThe first problem brought by MEV is network congestion. When two searchers compete for the MEV opportunities to be included in the block, each will repeatedly reissue the transaction with a higher gas fee. This could be because of the bot’s bidding strategy or simply because the searcher noticed a higher bid in the peer-to-peer network. In our example above, 0x6B…6542 and 0xb8…7a3f issued 42 and 43 bids, respectively—this significantly increased network congestion.\nIn addition to that, chain congestion is also a problem. As we explained in our example, the miner would include both searcher A’s and B’s transactions because even if the transaction failed, the searcher still needs to pay a percentage of the gas fee simply for block inclusion.Failed transactions waste block space, artificially increasing block scarcity and resulting in a higher gas fee for ordinary users.\nA more severe problem on Ethereum related to MEV is a time-bandit attack. Proposers could re-propose a subchain to extract the MEV profits. For example, the current block height is 100. Instead of proposing block 101, proposers could propose blocks 51 to 100 again so they could extract MEV profits in these 50 blocks.\nSolution 1: Off-chain auctions between builders and searchers\nTo solve network congestion and chain congestion brought by MEV, Flashbots built an off-chain, first price, sealed bid auction system between builders and searchers called MEV-geth. Instead of doing PGA in the open network, searchers would privately send bundles to miners/proposers through MEV-geth.\nBundles are one or more transactions grouped and executed in a given sequence. Searchers are encouraged to set the gas price to 0 and pay builders for the block inclusion fee by using a special transfer function in the bundle. Miners/proposers would select the bundles with the highest bid and place this bundle at the top of the block—the winning bundle will be the first to be executed in a block, thus guaranteeing the success of the execution.\nSearchers could guarantee the atomic execution of the bundle by using smart contracts, which is the same way they make profits risk-free. Thus, searchers will only pay the miners/proposers if their bundles are executed successfully.\nWhat MEV-geth mitigates\nMEV-geth resolves the network congestion because no communication between searchers and miners/proposers will happen in the peer-to-peer network. Meanwhile, MEV-geth resolves the chain congestion because miners/proposers will not include failed transactions as searchers set the gas price to 0. Including a failed transaction will give no reward to miners/proposers. MEV-geth is also preferred for searchers because they only pay miners/proposers if their MEV extraction is successful.\nDrawbacks &amp; Problem 4: unfair profits for solo validator\nFirst, MEV-geth didn’t address the time-bandit attack. Miners/Proposers still have incentives to re-org the subchain to extract MEV. Second, after Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake in 2022, people started to notice that with searchers communicating with proposers off-chain, solo validators are making much less profit from MEV compared with the staking pool.\nIn Ethereum Proof of Stake, validators could be solo validators or join a staking pool with other validators. Consider a solo validator with 32ETH staked and a validity pool with 320ETH staked. While the pool has ten times more opportunities to extract MEV profits because they’re selected as proposers ten more times than solo validators, the pool is much more sophisticated in exploiting MEV opportunities compared to solo validators because they could spend much more effort on optimizing profits for each time they’re selected as proposer.\nTo help solo validators benefit from MEV, Vitalik proposed a system that outsources block building to a group of specialized players called builders, called Proposer Builder Separation.\nSolution 2: Proposer Builder Separation (PBS)\nIn our previous model, we had three players: searchers, ordinary users, and proposers. In this section, we will introduce builders responsible for preparing full blocks that proposers will propose.\nAs we mentioned above, in Ethereum Proof of Stake, proposers are responsible for generating a full block by selecting transactions or bundles from those they received. In PBS, the full block is prepared by builders, and proposers only need to select the full block with the highest bid.\nAnyone could be a builder. A builder is expected to build a block with the highest profit, including MEV profit and priority gas fees. Builders would bid for block proposing by broadcasting a block header, which contains the commitment to a block body and specifies the amount of reward they are willing to pay the proposers. The proposer then commits to proposing a specific block by signing the block header. After seeing the signature from the proposer, builders reveal the full block.\nWe need to update the underlying consensus mechanism to implement PBS on Ethereum. Currently, there are only two cases in a given slot: either the proposer broadcasts a block or not. However, with the PBS proposal as mentioned above, three cases could happen:\n\nProposer didn’t commit on any block header\nProposer commits on a block header, but the builder didn’t reveal the full block\nProposer commits on a block header, and the full block is revealed\n\nTherefore, a temporary solution is to implement an off-chain auction system between builders and proposers, where they could communicate off-chain on which block the proposer will propose. In this way, we keep the underlying Ethereum consensus mechanism unchanged.\nMEV-boost: current off-chain implementation of PBS\nFlashbot provided an OFF-CHAIN proposer builder separation API called MEV-boost that outsources block building to builders. Since the auction system between builders and proposers happens off-chain, a doubly trusted third party, relay, is needed here.\nMEV-boost works as explained in Figure 5. In a given slot,\n\nBuilders send the full block to a relay. In the last transaction in the block, the builder transfers some amount of ETH to the proposer; this is the bid to the proposer.\nRelay hides the details of the block, especially the last transaction, and sends just the block header and the bid amount to the proposer.\nThe Proposer commits to proposing the block by signing the block header.\nUpon seeing the signature from the proposer, the relay reveals the full block to the proposer.\nProposer proposes the block to other validators for voting.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Diagram explaining the role of relays. Builders receive bundles from searchers and build full blocks. After a full block is built, builders send it to relays. Relays send only the block header to the proposer and reveal the full block after seeing the proposer's signature on the block header. \n\n\nIn the current system, builders cannot send the full block directly to proposers without using a relay. This is because proposers could propose only the block’s last transaction. If the proposer needs to sign the header, there is no guarantee that the full block revealed by the builder includes the promised profit. The relay acts as a middleman that verifies the builders’ blocks and ensures that builders only get paid when the block is proposed. This is similar to how eBay acts as a trusted intermediary between buyers and sellers.\nProblem 5: Timing Game\nA big problem with MEV-boost is the existence of a doubly-trusted third party: relayers. Another issue in PBS (both with and without relays) is that proposers and builders may delay the block revealing time so they have more time for MEV extraction. A known consequence of this behavior is a missed slot.\nIn an honest case, a block should be proposed at the beginning of the slot, and selected validators would vote on the block within 4 seconds. However, a proposer could delay the release of the block so that just over 40% of selected validators voted on the block. With more time, they could collect more transactions and harvest the MEV profits on these additional transactions. This is called timing game. Timing game is possible and profitable, but not exploited yet. Time is Money\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/max-extractable-value/","title":"Maximal Extractable Value in Ethereum"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/mini-code-props/":{"body":"It is nearly inevitable that bugs will appear in a codebase during software development. To catch these bugs before they lead to real-world consequences,\nthe formal verification community has developed a wide variety of tools for ensuring code correctness. These tools fall\ninto two main classes: Automated Reasoning and Interactive Theorem Proving. Unfortunately, proving code properties with either of these approaches tends\nto require significant effort from human experts. In this blog post, we describe early steps towards using the emerging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto automate the labor intensive portions of the Interactive Theorem Proving paradigm. In particular, we introduce miniCodeProps, a benchmark\nfor automated Interactive Theorem Proving on code properties.\nBackground\nVerification with Automated Reasoning\nAutomated Reasoning tools such as boolean satisfiability solvers (a.k.a. SAT solvers) take formulas in a form of propositional logic\nas input and use “brute reasoning” to search for\na variable assignment such that the input formula evaluates to True. If no such assignment exists, a proof of this\nfact is returned. If we want to verify that the outputs of a function \\(y = f(x)\\) satisfy property \\(p(y)\\), we can encode \\(\\exists x, \\lnot p(f(x)) \\) into CNF and run a SAT solver.\nIf \\(f\\) fails to satisfy \\(p\\) on any input(s), the solver will return one such input as a satisfying assignment to the formula. Otherwise, the returned proof that the formula\nis unsatisfiable is equivalent to a proof that \\(\\forall x, p(f(x))\\), i.e. \\(f\\) satisfies \\(p\\) on all possible inputs.\nFor example, \\(f\\) may be a function that takes an unsorted list of numbers \\(x\\) as input and returns \\(y\\), a new sorted list. If \\(p(y)\\) mathematically encodes the statement\n“the list \\(y\\) is ordered from least to greatest”, then solving the aforementioned \\(\\exists x, \\lnot p(f(x)) \\) is effectively asking the SAT solver to search for input lists\nthat cause \\(f\\) to not return a sorted list. In practice, verifying a sorting algorithm requires proving other properties as well. If \\(f\\) always sets \\(y\\) to an empty list,\n\\(p(y)\\) will always be True! We follow up with this example in a later section.\nSatisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers allow more complicated variable types such as integers and arrays, as well as clauses that use for-all quantifiers. These extensions make encoding correctness properties\nsimpler, but make producing proofs of unsatisfiability much more difficult.\nWhile this formulation succeeds in many practical settings, solving SAT and SMT formulas\nis an NP-hard problem. In practice, when an input formula takes prohibitively long to solve, a human expert must modify the problem encoding by adding extra information such as\nan inductive invariant hint to reduce the search space. Although not the focus of this post, recent work  has shown that\nOpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM can be used to reliably produce SMT encodings of some problems.\nVerification with Interactive Theorem Proving\nIn contrast to the Automated Reasoning approach, Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) were explicitly designed to include a human expert in the proving process. Well known ITP\nenvironments such as Isabelle, Coq, and Lean require that the user specify the\nprogram and the property to be proved in mathematical languages unique to each ITP, which are about as expressive\nas the SMT language while maintaining more human readability. The user is then presented with the current state of the proof, containing the goal(s) and other relevant information.\nThe user then adds lines to a growing proof of the property in which each line modifies the goal(s) in a mathematically valid way that is verified by the ITP until\nall goals are proven. At first glance, this paradigm seems far inferior to Automated Reasoning in terms of scaling potential because a human expert is an integral part of the\nproving process. However, recent advances in LLM capabilities provide hope that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will soon be able to automate proof writing in ITP environments.\nOur work uses Lean 4 to state and prove theorems about code. The image below is a sample Lean file containing two functions involving\nbinary trees: tree_size and balanced (section B). Section C contains a property of these functions written\nin Lean, namely that when balanced returns true on any tree t, tree_size(t) returns an odd number.\nThe definition of Odd is part of  mathlib (Lean’s library of mathematical statements and theorems), which is imported in section A.\nSection D contains the proof of this property. The proof state (section E) displays Lean’s internal proof environment at the location of the cursor, which in this case is\nline 20 in section D. The yellow items in section E describe objects available for use in the proof, i.e. p and q are the left and right branches of the input tree.\nThe proof state also contains facts available for use in the proof, i.e. hb stores the fact that a tree with x as the root and p and q as branches is balanced.\nThe final line of section E is the “goal” of the proof, which by line 20 has been simplified to showing that adding 1 to the tree sizes of p and q results in an odd number.\n \nNew Applications of LLMs\nMathematical theorem proving\nMathematics research currently relies on extensive peer review to spot errors in new publications. This process can be difficult and time consuming, without any guarantees\non review quality. To address this problem, several well-known mathematicians have begun to\nformalize parts of their work in Lean. From a computer scientist’s point of view, this context provides\nseveral possible avenues of research, such as generating new formal and informal proofs and translating between the two types. In this post, we focus on formal proof generation.\nRecently, LLMs fine-tuned on medium size formal math datasets such as Lean Mathlib have shown state of the art performance on the formal mathematical proof\nbenchmark miniF2F (see lego-prover, llemma, Draft-Sketch-Prove, HTPS, DeepSeek-Prover, and this improved data sampling method).\nCode Generation\nCode generation, modification, and repair have been active areas of research for decades. Recent work has shown significant progress\non influential benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP.\nIn principle, the advances in this area are directly applicable to formal theorem proving.\nLean 4 is both a programming language and an ITP, so generating Lean proofs can also be viewed as generating code in the Lean programming language.\nAdditionally, several code generation models can generate accompanying natural language explanations of generated code. If a language model can explain\nhow code works, it may also be able to generate proofs of properties of said code.\nChallenges and Mitigations\nAlthough LLMs can prove formal mathematical theorems and explain generated code, the niche of proving program properties with LLMs is underexplored due to several technical challenges.\nIncorporating Context\nUntil recently, input size constraints have been a well-known problem for LLMs. In particular, early LLMs could only process between hundreds and thousands of words at a time\ndue to various architecture choices and constraints. Recent advances have significantly increased the effective allowed input size:\nsee this post for an introduction to the topic.\nIn early work on using LLMs for interactive theorem proving, only the proof state (see section E in the image above) was used as input due to input size constraints.\nIncreases in allowed input length have allowed prompts about code to also include code dependencies and file context, which are both useful to humans when reasoning about ITP proofs.\nHallucinations\nAs people use Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT more often and for an increasing variety of tasks,\nLLM hallucinations have garnered significant attention. Essentially, LLMs sometimes fabricate\ninformation that appears plausible but does not hold up under scrutiny. For example, an LLM might produce a proof that contains logical errors or uses nonexistent lemmas.\nMany partial solutions exist for handling hallucinations; some examples include self-consistency\nand Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nITPs provide a somewhat unique context where hallucinations are caught immediately by the ITP’s internal verifier. When\nan LLM produces an invalid proof step, the error message produced by the ITP can also be used to prompt the LLM for an alternate proof step (see DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5),\nsimilarly to how humans interact with an ITP.\nBenchmark Availability\nIn large part, progress on tasks such as code generation and (in)formal math proofs is driven by reporting progress on widely accepted benchmarks such as HumanEval, MATH, and miniF2F.\nAt the time of writing, no such benchmark exists for proofs of code properties. The main contribution of our work in this field is the creation of miniCodeProps, a new benchmark containing\na variety of programs and corresponding properties to be proven in Lean 4. We intend that miniCodeProps be used to benchmark the capabilities of LLMs to produce correct proofs\nof code properties.\nBenchmark: miniCodeProps\nminiCodeProps is intended to mirror the utility of miniF2F (a formal mathematical theorem proving benchmark) in the space of proving properties of code.\nWe describe the way the benchmark was created and our baseline experiments with several techniques from code generation and theorem proving literature.\nBenchmark Collection\nThe programs and associated properties in miniCodeProps were all sourced from the Tons of Inductive Problems (TIP) dataset. We selected files from TIP with properties\ndescribing functions defined in TIP, then translated those properties and functions from Haskell to Lean 4. During the translation process, we were required to prove several\nlemmas in Lean regarding the termination of the recursive functions being defined. These lemmas are also properties of the functions translated from TIP, and are also included\nin the benchmark. Each example in our benchmark contains the text of sections A, B, C, and E in the example above, where section E is the initial proof state.\nAn automated ITP system succeeds on a given example by producing a correct section D, where correctness is verified by Lean. The next section explores the common methods such ITP\nsystems use to produce proofs.\nMethods\nIn this section we will address the following questions:\n\nHow do you programmatically check generated proofs?\nWhat are current and potential future techniques used to generate proofs using LLMs?\n\nThere are two main classes of proof generation techniques in current automated ITP literature:\n\nNext-Step tactic prediction: one line is generated at a time until the proof is complete\nFull-Proof generation: entire candidate proofs are generated until a proof is found\nIn practice, researchers designate a computational budget (for example, 8 attempts at Full-Proof generation) and terminate the proof search process once this budget is reached\nwithout a successful proof.\nWe evaluate both approaches on miniCodeProps.\n\nInteraction with Lean\nInteraction with the Lean 4 kernel is necessary for most Next-Step tactic generation and self-refinement Full-Proof generation methods. Our work uses the Lean REPL, a tool that\nfacilitates backtracking and continuing from specific steps in the proof. Each time Lean code is generated, Lean REPL checks the validity of the line in the context of the definitions\nand earlier proof lines. The REPL returns error messages if any invalid steps were taken, or the new proof state containing the list of remaining goals (statements to prove) otherwise.\nWhen the list of goals in the proof state is empty, the original theorem has been proven correct.\nNext-Step Tactic Generation\nAt the beginning of a proof and after each valid line, the Lean kernel generates a proof state, i.e. a collection of the variables and hypotheses defined in the current context\n(section E of the earlier example).\nAs Lean is also a programming language, the proof state can also be thought of as a debug trace of the current context (theorems are effectively functions that produce certificates that a property holds! See Curry-Howard). Tactics are functions that modify the proof state. Common examples include simp, a\nbroadly useful simplification tactic that attempts a wide array of other common tactics, and rw, which attempts to use specific lemmas provided by the user to modify the goal.\nThe most basic variant of Next-step tactic generation is a function from proof state to a set of possible next tactics. There are many ways to extend this idea. For example,\nexpanding the input to include other relevant Lean code and lemmas or expanding output to give each possible next tactic a “confidence” score describing the likelihood that the proof\ncan be completed using the generation as the next tactic. In the earlier example, a successful Next-Step tactic prediction given the proof state in section E would be the line\nafter the cursor in section D, i.e. unfold balanced at hb. To produce a full proof, the system starts from the initial proof state and repeatedly generates possible next tactics\nuntil the proof state has an empty list of goals.\nFull-Proof Generation\nResearchers have discovered that LLMs in some cases exhibit In-Context Learning: the ability to generalize patterns\nfrom a small number of examples provided in the prompt. Additionally,\nthe data that massive LLMs such as GPT-4 are trained on contains examples of proofs in Lean 3, as well as in other proof assistants such as Isabelle and Coq.\nTherefore, it is reasonable to expect that LLMs could generate full proofs of a given theorem statement given example pairs of theorem statement and proof.\nConcretely, the “theorem statement” used is generally sections A, B, C, and optionally E in the earlier example, while the expected output is an entire valid\nproof (section D). In our experiments we ignored initial proof state (section E) as it was mostly redundant with the theorem definition (section C) in our examples.\nDeciding inputs and outputs is a good first step, but it is generally suboptimal to just send the LLM a list of input-output pairs. The nascent field of Prompt Engineering provides\na variety of approaches to constructing high-performing prompts for language models. One such technique is to tell the language model it\nis an expert, i,e, begin with “You are an expert in producing Lean 4 proofs tasked with…”. A second common approach is “few-shot prompting,” the approach of providing several examples\nof input and desired output in the prompt. Another common approach is self-refinement, i.e. using any available output describing the results\nof the previous LLM output as an input to the next prompt.\nminiCodeProps Baselines\nWe tested several models using Next-Step tactic generation, and GPT-4 for Full-Proof generation. Results can be found in the table below.\nLLMStep is a framework for getting Next-Step proof suggestions from arbitrary LLMs in VScode. We modified it to communicate with Lean REPL\ndirectly and output confidence scores for each generated next step. We applied the following proof search approach:\n\nGiven proof state, generate 10 (next tactic, confidence score) pairs.\nDeduplicate and pick the 5 highest confidence tactics.\nSend each tactic to Lean REPL using the current state. For each valid proof state returned:\n\nIf the proof state is invalid (i.e. the tactic caused Lean REPL to error), ignore it.\nIf there are no goals remaining, return the list of steps taken.\nIf the max proof search depth has not been reached, repeat steps 1-3 on the new proof state.\nThe LLMs we used were all fine-tuned to produce Lean tactics from proof state. ntp-context-1.3b in particular was also fine-tuned to use surrounding file context. Due to computational constraints, we used a proof search depth of 3 in our experiments.\n\n\n\nFor our Full-Proof generation approach, we constructed a base prompt containing three examples of program property proofs similar to those in miniCodeProps. For each property in miniCodeProps,\nwe appended the property and accompanying context (function definitions and lemmas) to the base prompt and requested a full proof. We requested 8 responses from GPT-4 and reported success\nif any succeeded.\nMethodLLMMedley (Easy)Termination (Med)Sorting (Hard)\nNext-StepPythia2.8b44/861/280/63\nNext-StepLlemma7b46/862/280/63\nNext-Stepntp-context-1.3b38/860/280/63\nFull-ProofGPT-4-turbo44/861/280/63\n\nOur results indicate that proving properties of programs is nontrivial for simple applications of fine-tuned language models and basic few-shot prompting of GPT-4. Further analysis of\nthe failure modes of these models (see Sorting Discussion), as well as more sophisticated (and higher computational budget) approaches to proof search will likely improve\nthese results in the near future.\nIn the following section, we analyze the Sorting component of miniCodeProps and a sample incorrect proof generated by GPT-4.\nDiscussion: Sorting\nThe Sorting section of miniCodeProps contains a variety of sorting algorithms with associated properties. In particular, after defining 11 sorting algorithms on\nlists of natural numbers, TIP defines the following properties for each algorithm:\n\nthe algorithm returns an ordered list\nthe list returned by the algorithm has the same number of elements as the input list\nthe list returned by the algorithm is a permutation of the original list\nthe algorithm is equivalent to another sorting algorithm (insertion sort)\n\nProperties 1 and 4 are deeply connected; there is a unique way to order a list of natural numbers. However, this fact itself is a property of the ordered function used!\nThe best way to prove property 4 for most algorithms may very well be proving property 1 and that single fact about lists of natural numbers, but I argue that any\ntheorem prover that does so has demonstrated a valuable skill. The property 2 is also strictly easier than property 3. This allows for interesting analysis of future\ntheorem provers: will they succeed on proving property 2 but struggle on property 3? Or, will they prove property 3 directly and use its corollary to immediately prove property 2?\nUnfortunately, the approaches we have tested so far have not succeeded at proving any properties of sorting algorithms. However, the ways in which they fail are informative. Below we\nhave a sample output of GPT-4 attempting to prove that heapsort (hsort below) returns an ordered list. The proof looks mostly reasonable to a Lean user, a common characteristic\nof LLM-produced output. Notable problems occur on lines 25, 31, and 40.\n\nOn line 25, GPT-4 attempts to generalize MyHeap, a type of object defined earlier. Induction with generalization\nis a common idea in many proofs of recursive programs, but the object generalized is always some object in the proof context, not a type. Generalizing a type of object is semantically\nmeaningless, and indeed the lean kernel throws its first error on this line.\nOn line 31, GPT-4 again demonstrates interesting but incorrect behavior. numElem_merge_branches_lt is a lemma stating that merging two heaps results in a heap with fewer elements\nthan a heap with a new value at the root and the two original heaps as children. GPT-4 invokes this lemma, but does not provide any arguments instead using ... (not valid Lean syntax),\nseemingly trying to tell the user “I don’t know what should go here, so you fill it in.” However, the h that GPT-4 names this invocation is not used in the proof. I interpret this as follows: GPT-4’s model of correct Lean proofs includes invoking lemmas defined in the context, but does not include the logic necessary to effectively use such lemmas.\nConclusion\nOur baselines for miniCodeProps demonstrate that despite recent advances in LLM-powered mathematical theorem proving in ITPs, proving complex code properties remains difficult.\nWhile future work on benchmarking this capability will likely expand outside of TIP to include properties of the wide range of non-inductive functions and data, miniCodeProps represents\na challenging first step. When models are capable of automatically producing proofs in the Sorting category, theorem proving technology will have taken a large step towards\nthe elusive goal of automatic generation of provably correct code.  We hope the theorem proving community finds miniCodeProps useful for improving the capabilities of automated ITP systems.\nReference List\n\nminiCodeProps on Arxiv\nminiCodeProps benchmark\nWhat is an LLM blog post\nCNF explanation\nBrute Reasoning explanation\nSAT solver unsatisfiability proofs\nSMT solver proofs\nClover: Closed-Loop Verifiable Code Generation\nGPT-4 Technical Report\nLean homepage\nBinary Tree explanation\nTerrence Tao formalizing parts of his work in Lean\nEnhancing Neural Theorem Proving through Data Augmentation and Dynamic Sampling Method\nLarge Language Models Meet NL2Code: A Survey\nMBPP Dataset\nNatural Language Generation and Understanding of Big Code for AI-Assisted Programming: A Review\nContext Length blog post\nLLM Hallucinations blog post\nSelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\nDeepSeek-Prover-V1.5: Harnessing Proof Assistant Feedback for Reinforcement Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search\nminiF2F dataset\nTons of Inductive Problems (TIP) dataset\nLean REPL\nCurry-Howard Correspondence\na Survey on In-Context Learning\nSelf-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback\nLLMStep\nPythia2.8b fine-tuning\nLlemma7b fine-tuning\nntp-context-1.3b fine-tuning\nOpenAI documentation for GPT-4-turbo\n\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/mini-code-props/","title":"miniCodeProps: a Benchmark for Proving Code Properties"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/modeling-bbr/":{"body":"\nIn 2006, Senator Ted Stevens infamously described the Internet as a “series of tubes’‘, where “filled tubes’’ delayed his email. While Senator Stevens was ridiculed at the time for his simplistic understanding of the Internet, his characterization was not entirely wrong:\n\n“It’s a series of tubes. And if you don’t understand, those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message in it, it gets in line and it’s going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of material…”\n\nThe more technical term for what Senator Stevens describes here is congestion. Logical “tubes” are created between two end-points across a network by transport protocols like TCP. These tubes run over physical links with limited capacity which may become filled by competing traffic. If end-points send more data into the network than the capacity of these links, the network becomes overloaded and congested, delaying packets and degrading throughput. If congestion goes unchecked, the network can become so slow it grinds to a halt, a condition called congestion collapse.\nHistorically, all senders could share an overloaded network if all senders used the same congestion control algorithm (CCA). For example, if all senders used a loss-based CCA like TCP Reno, then all senders could share the network both fairly and efficiently, without explicit coordination between the senders. However, over the past 30 years since TCP Reno’s deployment, large content providers have proposed and deployed novel CCAs to keep up with growing demands of a faster Internet, emerging applications like video conferencing, and billions of mobile users. Since the senders must implement congestion control, content providers can deploy any CCA. Consequently, if we are moving away from a homogenous deployment of one loss-based CCA to a wild-west of many CCAs, the fairness of the Internet is at stake.\nMost notable of these new algorithms is TCP BBR, proposed and deployed by Google in 2016, including an open-source implementation in the Linux kernel. When Google published BBR, it resulted in a surge of researchers studying the algorithm; could BBR fairly share with the already widely deployed loss-based CCA TCP Cubic? Several studies showed empirically with experiments in controlled testbeds that BBR could be very unfair to Cubic with little explanation for why. Consequently, in this work, we ask if we can determine when and why BBR is unfair to Cubic.\nIn the past, researchers have used modelling to understand a CCA’s behavior. For example, the Mathis equation showed TCP Reno’s throughput is inversely proportional to the loss rate. So in this work, we build a similar model to understand a BBR flow’s throughput when competing with other flows.\nOur model has an important finding: BBR’s throughput when competing with loss-based algorithms does not depend on the number of competing loss-based flows. Regardless of the number of competing flows, BBR flows will always achieve a fixed fraction of the available throughput.\nHow does BBRv1 work?\nBBR is designed to be a rate-based algorithm. In contrast to window-based TCP variants (for example Cubic and Reno) which control the amount of in-flight data, BBR’s goal is to figure out what its fair share of the bottleneck link is and to pace the sending of packets at exactly that rate.\nA BBR flow determines its sending rate by repeatedly probing for bandwidth (in its ProbeBW state) over 8 round trip times (RTTs). For 6 RTTs, BBR will send at rate \\(R\\), its current maximum achieved throughput. Then BBR will send at a higher rate to see if it can get better throughput. It does this by increasing its sending rate to \\(1.25R\\) for 1 RTT and observing the achieved throughput. Finally, it will reduce its sending rate to \\(0.75R\\) for 1 RTT to drain any excess packets from the queue. If a BBR flow observes a higher achieved throughput, it will adjust its sending rate \\(R\\) to what it now thinks is its maximum throughput. In total, these steps (ProbeBW) take 8 RTTs. BBR will repeat this 8 RTT cycle over and over again.\nWhen one BBR flow is not sharing the bottleneck link with any other flow, repeatedly probing for bandwidth allows BBR to both maximize throughput and minimize delay by figuring out exactly how much bandwidth is available.\nBut what happens during ProbeBW when BBR competes with Reno or Cubic?\nDuring ProbeBW, by putting additional data into the network when the bottleneck link and queue are already full, BBR will cause packet loss. Because Reno and Cubic are loss-based algorithms, they will reduce their sending rates in response to packet loss.\nBBR on the other hand, will not reduce its rate; instead it will see that it was able to get better throughput and will increase its sending rate. This causes Reno and Cubic to end up with less bandwidth than BBR.\n\n\nFig. 1:  1 BBR vs. 1 Cubic. (10 Mbps network, 32 x bandwidth delay product queue). During ProbeBW, BBR causes Cubic to back off.\nDuring ProbeBW, BBR will put more and more packets into the bottleneck queue, increasing its bandwidth estimate. This process will repeat over and over again. While the Cubic flows back off, BBR will push more and more packets into the queue. We can observe this behavior in Figure 1.\nGiven what we know about BBR so far, during ProbeBW, BBR should just keep putting more and more packets into the network until Cubic is starved. However, from Figure 1, we see that eventually BBR stops probing for more bandwidth.\nUnder competition, BBR is window-limited\nSurprisingly, we find that under competition, BBR’s rate is not determined by its bandwidth estimate but by a window-limit called the in-flight cap.\nBBR limits the amount of data in-flight to two Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP), as a safety mechanism in case of delayed and stretched ACKs. BDP is a product of BBR’s estimate of bandwidth and end-to-end latency.\nWe find that this in-flight cap is what ultimately dictates what fraction of the link a BBR flow will get when competing with other flows and is what stops BBR during ProbeBW in Figure 1.\nTherefore, if we can model the in-flight cap, we can figure out what BBR’s throughput will be when competing with loss-based flows.\nA simple model for BBR’s throughput\nTo derive a simple model of BBR’s in-flight cap, and consequently its throughput, we assume that we have 1 BBR flow vs. any number of Cubic flows in a deep-buffered network (for example in Figure 1 we set the buffer size to 32 BDP).\n\nFig. 2:  Variables in simple BBR model.\nFirst, we define some variables in the model shown in Figure 2. This illustrates what the bottleneck link and queue might look like. We assume the bottleneck link capacity is \\(c\\) and the bottleneck queue size is \\(q\\). If the Cubic flows occupy \\(p\\) fraction of the queue, we assume that 1 BBR flow occupies the remaining \\((1-p)\\) fraction of the queue.\n\nFig. 3: A simple model for BBR’s queue occupancy/throughput. This model says 1 BBR flow can get up to half of the available queue/link capacity when competing with any number of Cubic flows.\nGiven this, we can draw a figure of Cubic’s queue occupancy vs. BBR’s, as shown in Figure 3. First, the blue line, shows that if Cubic occupies \\(p\\) fraction of the queue, then BBR must have \\(1-p\\) data in-flight to occupy the rest of the queue.\nNext, we need to model what BBR’s bandwidth and RTT estimates will be, so we can also draw the 2 BDP in-flight cap. BBR’s bandwidth estimate is equivalent to BBR’s fraction of the queue (which we have already said is \\(1-p\\) times the link capacity), so its bandwidth estimate is \\((1-p)c\\).\nBBR determines its RTT estimate by continually tracking the minimal RTT it has seen over the last 10 seconds. Every 10 seconds, BBR goes into ProbeRTT state and lowers its in-flight data to four packets, so it can drain any of its packets from the queue and see what the minimum RTT is, minus any self-induced queueing delay. Since BBR will drain its packets from the queue, the remaining packets in the queue will be Cubic. Thus, assuming a negligible propagation delay, BBR’s RTT estimate is going to be equivalent to Cubic’s queue occupancy divided by the link capacity, so BBR’s RTT estimate is \\((pq) / c\\).\nThus, BBR’s in-flight cap = $$2 * BW * RTT = 2 * (1-p)c * (pq) / c = 2q(p-p^2).$$ This quadratic equation for the in-flight cap turns out to be the green line in Figure 3.\nReturning to Figure 1, what we are seeing here is BBR moving up this blue line, putting more and more data into the queue until the amount of data it has in-flight meets its in-flight cap. This intersection is illustrated in Figure 3 by the dashed orange line.\nThis model shows that 1 BBR flow can get up to half of the link when competing with any number of Cubic flows! This is why we see unfairness between 1 BBR flow and 2 or more Cubic flows.\nA more robust model for BBR’s throughput\nThus far, we have made many simplifying assumptions to make a simple model of BBR’s throughput. Our IMC paper builds a more complete model of BBR’s throughput when competing with any number of loss-based flows, relaxing those assumptions. The roboust model is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFig.4: The robust model for BBR’s throughput/link fraction when competing with loss-based flows. Notably, none of the variables in the model depend on the number of loss-based flows.\nFigure 4 highlights the variables that impact BBR’s fraction of the link and throughput. Here the queue size is a multiple of BDP=\\(Xcl\\) where \\(X\\) is the multiple, \\(c\\) is the link capacity, and \\(l\\) is the link propagation delay. In addition, \\(N\\) is the number of BBR flows. Notably, none of these variables depend on the loss rate or the number of loss-based flows. Consequently, BBR can be unfair to Cubic when there are more Cubic flows than BBR flows because the BBR flow’s aggregate fraction of the link will not be proportional to the number of flows.\nThe robust model can predict BBR’s throughput when competing against Cubic flows with a median error of 5% and 8% for Reno.\nIn summary, this model has two important explanations for why BBR can be unfair to Cubic:\n\nWhile BBR is supposed to be a rate-based algorithm, when competing, BBR is window-limited. As a result, although one of BBR’s goals is to minimize queueing delay, it will fill network buffers when competing with loss-based algorithms.\nBBR’s throughput when competing with loss-based algorithms does not depend on the number of competing loss-based flows. As a result, a single BBR flow will grab a fixed fraction of the link regardless of the number of competing flows.\n\nGoogle recently proposed BBRv3 (preceded by BBRv2) which aims to address the fairness issues discussed in this work and other fairness concerns by incorporating loss into BBR’s model of the network. An interesting direction for future work is to study BBRv3’s interactions with loss-based CCAs.\nThis blog is based on a paper published at IMC 2019: Modeling BBR’s Interactions with Loss-Based Congestion Control.\n\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/modeling-bbr/","title":"Modeling BBRv1's Interactions with Loss-Bassed Congestion Control"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/network-usable-information/":{"body":"In large cloud service providers such as AWS, the customer provides an attributed graph and would like to perform tasks such as recommendations (i.e., link prediction in a graph) using message-passing methods within restricted budgets.\nAn attributed graph consists of both the graph structure and the node features.\nAs one of the message-passing methods, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly used for graph tasks by propagating node features through the graph structure.\nHowever, it is possible that not all the information in the provided graph is usable for solving the task.\nTraining a GNN would thus be a waste of time and resources for the customer.\nTherefore, we aim to answer two questions:\n\nGiven a graph with node features, how can we tell whether utilizing both graph structure and node features will yield better performance than utilizing either of them separately?\nHow can we know what information in the graph (if any) is usable to solve the tasks, namely, node classification and link prediction?\n\nOur goal is to design a metric for measuring how informative the graph structure and node features are for the task at hand, which we call network usable information (NUI).\nIn this blog post, we introduce how to measure the information in the graph, and to exploit it for solving the graph tasks. This blog post is based on our research paper, “NetInfoF Framework: Measuring and Exploiting Network Usable Information” [1], presented at ICLR 2024.\nWhat is an attributed graph?\n\n\n\nFigure 1. An example of an attributed social network graph, where the nodes denote the users, and the edges denote whether two users are friends.\n\n\nA graph is a data structure that includes nodes and edges, representing the connections between nodes.\nAn attributed graph indicates that each node in the graph has a set of features.\nFor example, Figure 1 shows the attributed graph for a social network.\nThe nodes represent the users, illustrated as circles with university acronyms.\nThe edges indicate whether two users are friends, illustrated as black lines connecting circles.\nA node might also contain additional information:\n\nNode ID: illustrated as a thumbnail image of the user along with the user’s text name.\nNode attributes/features: represent whether the user is located in the US and whether the user likes to bike, illustrated as a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table.\nNode label: signifies the user’s university, categorized into two groups represented by blue and red colors with acronyms: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) or National Chiao Tung University (NCTU).\n\nIn fact, node labels are similar to node features, but they often contain missing values, which we are interested in predicting.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The mathematical representation of the attributed graph, including an adjacency matrix, node features, and node labels. The red question mark denotes unknown.\n\n\nIn Figure 2, the graph structure can be represented by an adjacency matrix, where 1 denotes the presence of an edge between two nodes, and 0 denotes no edge.\nThe node features are also represented by a matrix, where each feature is binary in the example, but it can also be continuous.\nThe node labels are represented by a matrix with one-hot encoding of the class label.\nWhat are the common graph tasks?\nWe consider the two common graph tasks:\n\nNode Classification\n\nGoal: Classify the unlabeled nodes, while some labeled nodes are given.\nExample: Given a social network with features, can we guess which university Bob goes to, i.e., the label of the gray node in Figure 1?\n\n\nLink Prediction\n\nGoal: Predict the potential additional edges in the graph.\nExample: Given a social network with features, can we guess whether David and Grace could become friends, i.e., the potential additional red-dash line in Figure 1?\n\n\n\nWhat are message-passing methods?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the nodes in a given graph projected into low-dimensional embedding space. The nodes that are more similar in the graph are closer in the embedding space.\n\n\nMessage-passing methods utilize the graph structure to propagate information from the neighbors of a node to the node itself.\nKnown as sum-product message-passing, belief propagation methods [2, 3] directly perform inference on the graph through several propagation iterations.\nAlthough they are fast and effective because they require neither parameters nor training, belief propagation methods are mainly designed to solve node classification problems based solely on the graph structure and usually do not consider node features.\nAnother variety of message-passing methods, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [4], are a class of deep learning models.\nThey are commonly used to generate low-dimensional embeddings of nodes to perform graph tasks by learning end-to-end with a training objective.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the nodes that are better connected in the graph are expected to have closer embeddings in the low-dimensional space.\nSome studies remove the non-linear functions in GNNs, and still achieve good performance, which we call linear GNNs [5, 6].\nOne of the many advantages of linear GNNs is that their node embeddings are available prior to model training.\nA comprehensive study on linear GNNs can be found in [6].\n\nMeasuring NUI: Would a message-passing method work in a given setting?\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Scenarios in which the message-passing method may not work well. (a): The graph structure exhibits no network effects. (b): Node features are not correlated with node labels.\n\n\nGiven an attributed graph, how can we measure the network usable information (NUI)? The message-passing method may not work well in the following two conditions:\n\nNo network effects: the graph structure is not useful to solve the graph task. In Figure 4(a), since every labeled node has one blue and one red neighbor, we cannot infer the label for Bob by examining its neighbors.\nUseless node features: the node features are not useful to solve the graph task. In Figure 4(b), we can see that whether a user likes to bike is not correlated with the user’s university.\n\nIf either of these two extreme conditions applies, a message-passing method is likely to fail in inferring the unknown node label, i.e., Bob’s university.\nHowever, it is very likely that the graph information has varying levels of usefulness, ranging between completely useful and completely useless.\nFor example, in Figure 2, only 1 out of 2 node features is useful: the node feature ‘located in the US’ is useful, while the node feature ‘likes to bike’ is not.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Illustration of structural embedding (left) and neighbors' feature embedding (right). (a): SVD is conducted on the adjacency matrix to extract structural embedding.

(c): Messages passed from a node's neighbors are aggregated to generate its node embedding.\n\n\nWe focus on analyzing whether GNNs will perform well in a given setting, which is an important problem in the industry.\nThe reason is that, for large cloud service providers, the customer provides them with an attributed graph and requests them to solve the graph task (e.g., recommendation) using GNNs within restricted budgets.\nHowever, if the given graph lacks network usable information (NUI), the resources spent on training GNNs will be wasted.\nTherefore, our method serves as a preliminary tool to determine whether resources should be allocated for training expensive deep models.\nA straightforward way is to analyze the node embedding of the given graph generated by GNNs, but this is only available after training, which is expensive and time-consuming.\nFor this reason, we propose to analyze the derived node embedding in linear GNNs, which can be precomputed before model training.\nMore specifically, we derive three types of node embedding that can comprehensively represent the information of the given graph, namely:\n\nStructural embedding (\\( U \\)): for the information of the graph structure. It is extracted by decomposing the adjacency matrix with singular value decomposition (SVD). Intuitively, the left singular vectors U give the information of the node community. For example, in Figure 5(a), U identifies that the first three users belong to the blue community, while the last four belong to the red community. This is useful when the node features are not useful to solve the graph task.\nFeature embedding (\\( F \\)): for the information of the node features. It consists of the original node features after dimensionality reduction. As shown in Figure 5(b), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [7] is used as the dimensionality reduction technique. This is useful when there are no network effects, i.e. the graph structure is not useful to solve the graph task.\nNeighbors’ feature embedding (\\( S \\)): for the information of the features aggregated from the neighbors. As shown in Figure 5(c), the messages are passed and aggregated from the neighbors for two steps. The intuition is that, in addition to the information from the user, the user’s neighbors also provide useful information to the task. Leveraging their information leads to better performance on the graph task. This is useful when both the graph structure and the node features are useful to solve the graph task.\n\nOnce we have the embedding that can represent the information of the nodes of the graph, we propose NetInfoF_Score, and link the metrics of graph information and task performance with the following proposed theorem:\nDefinition 1 (NetInfoF_Score of \\( Y \\) given \\( X \\)).\nGiven two discrete random variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), NetInfoF_Score \\( s \\) of \\( Y \\) given \\( X \\) is defined as:\n\\[ s = 2^{-H(Y|X)} \\]\nwhere \\( H(\\cdot | \\cdot) \\) denotes the conditional entropy [8].\nTheorem 1 (NetInfoF_Score).\nGiven two discrete random variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), NetInfoF_Score \\( s \\) of \\( Y \\) given \\( X \\) lower-bounds the accuracy:\n\\[ s = 2^{-H(Y|X)} \\leq accuracy(Y|X) = \\sum_{x \\in X}{\\max_{y \\in Y}{p_{x, y}}} \\]\nwhere \\( p_{x, y} \\) is the joint probability of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\nThe proof is in [1].\nThe intuition behind this theorem is that the conditional entropy of \\( Y \\) (e.g. labels) given \\( X \\) (e.g. “like biking”), is a strong indicator of how good of a predictor \\( X \\) is, to guess the target \\( Y \\).\nIt provides an advantage to NetInfoF_Score by giving it an intuitive interpretation, which is the lower-bound of the accuracy. When there is little usable information for the task, the value of NetInfoF_Score is close to random guessing.\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Our theorem holds, where NetInfoF_Score is always less than or equal to validation accuracy.\n\n\nIn Figure 6, each point represents the accuracy and NetInfoF_Score obtained by solving graph tasks using one type of node embedding.\nWe find that NetInfoF_Score lower-bounds the accuracy of the given graph task, as expected.\nIf an embedding has no usable information to solve the given task, NetInfoF_Score gives a score close to random guessing (see lower left corner in Figure 6).\nThe details of the experiment can be found in [1].\nExploiting NUI: How to solve graph tasks?\nIn this blog, we focus on explaining how to solve node classification. How to solve link prediction is more complicated, and the details can be found in [1].\nTo solve node classification, we concatenate different types of embedding, and the input of the classifier is as follows:\n\\[ U \\parallel F \\parallel S , \\]\nwhere \\( \\parallel \\) is concatenation, \\( U \\) is the structural embedding, \\( F \\) is the feature embedding, and \\( S \\) is the neighbors’ feature embedding. Among all the choices, we use logistic regression as the node classifier, as it is fast and interpretable.\nHow well does our proposed method perform?\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 1, applied on 12 real-world graphs, NetInfoF outperforms GNN baselines in 7 out of 12 datasets on node classification.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. NetInfoF_Score highly correlates to test performance in real-world datasets. Each point denotes the result of one type of embedding in each dataset.\n\n\nIn Figure 7, NetInfoF_Score is highly correlated with test performance on node classification.\nThis indicates that NetInfoF_Score is a reliable measure for deciding whether to use a GNN on the given graph or not in a short time, without any model training.\nNoting that although our theorem proves that NetInfoF_Score is a lower bound on training accuracy, it is possible for testing accuracy to be lower than the NetInfoF_Score (blue points below 45 degree line in Figure 7).\nConclusion\nIn this blog post we investigate the problem of predicting whether a message-passing method would work well on a given graph.\nTo solve this problem, we introduce our approach called NetInfoF to measure and exploit the network usable information (NUI).\nApplied on real-world graphs, NetInfoF not only correctly measures NUI with NetInfoF_Score, but also outperforms other baselines 7 out of 12 times on node classification.\nPlease find more details in our paper [1].\nReferences\n[1] Lee, M.

While I am the sole author of this blog post, the work it describes was done in collaboration with Darion Cassel, Limin Jia and Ruben Martins. A preprint of our paper is available here.\nIntroduction\nThe Node.js ecosystem\nThe growing Node.js ecosystem is comprised of millions of JavaScript packages. Each package typically exposes a set of public APIs, which are also commonly called entry points. Once a specific package is imported (e.g. by other packages), its public API can be called with arbitrary arguments. While a minority of Node.js packages are used in the frontend, we focus on packages providing backend functionality.\nArbitrary command injection and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in Node.js\nAs it has become more popular, the Node.js ecosystem has turned into an attractive target for attackers and prior work has shown that many packages in the Node.js ecosystem contain security vulnerabilities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nTwo of the most serious vulnerabilities that can be present in Node.js packages are Arbitrary Command Injection (ACI) and Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to execute commands or code on the system that runs the application.\nIn ACI vulnerabilities, sources of attacker-controlled inputs can influence the arguments to dangerous functions like exec or spawn, which execute the command given in the argument. With respect to ACE vulnerabilities, sources influence the arguments to functions like eval or the Function constructor, which take JavaScript code as a string and execute it as long as it is syntatically valid. These dangerous functions that should not be controlled by an attacker are commonly called sinks.\nOur attacker model\nWe assume that all arguments to entry points are potentially controlled by an attacker. While this may not apply to some packages where calls to entry points have arguments that are either hardcoded or come from a legitimate or trusted source, the large majority of vulnerabilities that we reported were acknowledged by the maintainers. We are currently responsibly disclosing the vulnerabilities we found to CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) authorities - CVE is a list of publicly disclosed security flaws. Each of those can have a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) which is a numerical score reflecting the severity of a vulnerability. We were already assigned 1 CVE with a 7.3 / 10 CVSS score.\nDynamic taint analysis\nWe are interested in finding whether a certain execution of an entry point call reveals a vulnerability, so we execute the target package many times with different inputs.\nDynamic taint analysis is a technique that allows us to know whether information from a source of attacker-controlled input like the arguments to the entry point is propagated to the arguments of dangerous functions like exec or eval. Such a propagation of information is also called a flow. We implement this technique by instrumenting the package code and extending primitive values like strings with extra information (commonly called taint) that signals whether the value can be controlled by the attacker or not. Sources are marked as tainted (i.e. influenced by the attacker) by default, and as the program execution progresses, operations on tainted values, like the concatenation of one constant string with a second string that comes from the attacker, create tainted results. In this example, the final string is at least partially controlled by the attacker. If we find that eval is called with tainted arguments, we report it as a flow!\nJust because a flow is found, it does not mean that the flow represents a real vulnerability. In addition to many other reasons, an attacker may be able to control the arguments to eval but may still be unable to execute arbitrary code if it is impossible to make it syntatically valid. Another example could be that the attacker controls the name of a function that is dynamically generated, but the package sanitizes every character that should not belong to a function name according to the JavaScript syntax. Dynamic taint analysis helps us find “potential” vulnerabilities which we have to later confirm using other methods.\nLimitations of prior work and how we address them\nGiven that NPM is such a large ecosystem of packages and each of them can be individually vulnerable, we would like to analyse them all.\nThere are several existing automated tools that identify ACI and ACE vulnerabilities, but most of these do not scale well and are not practical to use to analyse millions of packages like we did [7]. NodeMedic [8], a state-of-the-art system developed at CMU, is directly comparable to this work. NodeMedic was able to analyse 10,000 Node.js packages and found 155 flows but it was limited to sending a single hardcoded value as an argument to entry points. While this may be enough in many cases, the majority of entry points require their arguments to have specific types or structure. It remained to be seen how many more vulnerabilities could be discovered with a program exploration technique that aims to improve coverage.\nTo avoid having to manually check all flows, many of those being false positives, there is also work on automatically synthesizing exploits to prove that an attacker can indeed execute malicious commands or code by leveraging the vulnerability. NodeMedic was able to synthesize working exploits for 108 of the analysed packages, including 102 ACI exploits and 6 ACE exploits. Note the much lower number of ACE exploits. The main difficulty in synthesizing ACE exploits is the fact that the final payload needs to be syntatically valid JavaScript, and current synthesis techniques fail to solve such contraints efficiently.\nNodeMedic-FINE\n\nFigure 1 - NodeMedic-FINE diagram. In this post we only focus on the fuzzer and enumerator components. Refer to the paper for details about the remaining components.\nOur tool NodeMedic-FINE is an extension of NodeMedic with a set of self contained components that increase the number of flows and confirmed vulnerabilities significantly. Figure 1 presents a high-level description of the NodeMedic-FINE pipeline, from the target package to the generation of a candidate exploit that executes commands or code by leveraging found vulnerabilities.\nFirst, we develop a coverage-guided, type- and object-structure-aware fuzzer for Node.js packages and integrate it with NodeMedic.\nFuzzing is a software testing technique that involves sending automatically generated inputs to a program. Fuzzing tools like AFL [9] have been adapted for Node.js fuzzing [10]. These general-purpose tools predominantly generate byte sequences or strings, lacking intrinsic knowledge of JavaScript’s\nrich type system. While effective in many scenarios, searching the string space is not sufficient to uncover a significant number of vulnerabilities. NodeMedic-FINE’s fuzzer is\ntype- and structure-aware and can generate inputs for a variety of types and with complex structure, like objects with specific attributes that have to be themselves objects.\nSecondly, we develop another component which we call the Enumerator to aid in synthesizing ACE exploits. The Enumerator is responsible for, given a certain prefix, providing a number of alternative payload templates. It also provides great flexibility in the generation of ACE exploits. We will explain this process in detail later, but as a first example one could consider a function call like eval(\"return \" + attacker_input). In this case, the prefix is return and the enumerator takes that as an input and returns the right value for attacker_input such that the final argument to eval executes some code to prove that the vulnerability exists. This component was able to complete the majority of real world prefixes that we found, increasing the number of total ACE exploits by 15%.\nFuzzer\nIn order to explore more execution paths, we implement a coverage-guided fuzzer for Node.js\npackages, which aims to improve coverage by generating inputs of different types and with complex structure. In the following sections we will cover the design of the fuzzer in more technical detail, including a description of how different types are generated and how we refine input structure to further increase coverage.\nFuzzing loop\n\nFigure 2 - Fuzzer loop\nThe fuzzer’s interactions with the rest of NodeMedic-FINE are shown in Figure 2. The fuzzer takes an input specification for the entry point parameter being\nanalyzed. The fuzzer generates inputs based on the specification and sends them to be executed. We instrument the code being tested such that it not only performs dynamic taint analysis, but it also extracts coverage information and the attributes accessed via field access operations (known as getField in JavaScript). Finally, the fuzzer refines its input specification by considering the newly accessed attributes. Using Figure 2 as an example, once Feedback 1 is received by the fuzzer, which says that an attribute named command was accessed, the input specification for the next round is refined and the fuzzer will start being able to generate inputs with that attribute. This whole process is repeated until a time budget is exhausted.\nInput specification\nInputs are specified hierarchically by the following elements:\na list of types that the input can have (types);\na list of the number of samples taken for each type, where the i-th element specifies how many times the fuzzer sampled an input of the i-th type in the types list (sampled);\na list of coverage data for inputs of each type, where the i-th element represents the accumulated number of lines of code triggered by generated inputs of the i-th type in the types list (reward);\nand a recursive specification of the structure of the final input (structure).\nThe “Specification” boxes in Figure 2 are example specifications. The first box states that the first type in the list is an “Object” not yet sampled by the fuzzer. It sets the initial\nreward for Objects to 200 and defines its structure as empty.\nWeight adjustment\nOur fuzzer is coverage-guided: the amount of code executed by the previous inputs influences future input generation.\nThe reward and sampled data in the specification decide the adjustable weight used for tuning input generation.\nWe provide an initial weight for each type, based on the observation that some types are more commonly expected by\nNode.js package APIs than others. We aim to choose weights that increase the likelihood of generating inputs that trigger a\nflow. We found that object inputs are most likely to result in flows, followed by\nstrings, booleans, and functions. We seed the reward field in initial input specifications to reflect the above observation.\nThese weights are dynamically adjusted after each fuzzing iteration based on coverage.\nThe fuzzer only knows how effective each type is at improving coverage after it has tried them\nall. At the same time, there is often a tradeoff between continuing to explore inputs of types that have already shown promise in the past and\ntrying out inputs of types that have not been explored much. This is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma [11].\nWhen deciding which new type to explore, we adopted an approach studied by prior work [12] based on a Poisson process. In our case, we consider each type t, with $$\\lambda_t = \\frac{reward_t}{sampled_t}$$\nThe higher this value, the more likely it is for type t to be generated by the fuzzer.\nWe consider the execution of a block of code to be an independent event.\nEach type distribution estimates the expected number of lines of code that we will execute, if we choose this type.\nWe sample from each type distribution and choose the type with\nthe largest sample value. Using this approach, it is more likely\nfor input types that were effective in the past to have higher\nsample values and therefore to be chosen more frequently,\nwhile still making it possible for types that were not effective\nin the past to also be chosen eventually.\nObject reconstruction\nAccording to the initial specification, the fuzzer starts by generating empty objects. For the fuzzer to generate objects with\nuseful structure, we extended NodeMedic’s taint instrumentation to keep track of the field names whenever a getField\noperation is performed. This information is given as feedback to the fuzzer. At the end of each iteration, the input specification is updated to include newly discovered attributes.\nFor example, in Figure 2 “Feedback 1” from the first run of the fuzzer states that it covered 117 lines of new code and accessed the field “command”. The input specification is then updated to\n“Specification 2”: with new coverage data and more detailed object structure. The fuzzer then generates a new input with the field “command” set to a random input.\nEnumerator\nGenerating valid JavaScript payloads\nSynthesizing syntactically valid JavaScript payloads is a key challenge for confirming ACE flows.\nThe final argument to the sink needs to not only be valid JavaScript, but also execute the intended payload.  Consider the following example\n\nHere we see a synthetic example that demonstrates these challenges. It shows an entry point called evaluate where the expected functionality is to return a number corresponding to double the value returned by evaluating the given argument as a mathematical expression.\nIf we import the package and then use it as: evaluate(\"1+1\") it returns 4. Notice that the expression to evaluate is given as a string and is interpreted as JavaScript.\nA naive attempt to exploit could be evaluate(\"1);console.log(\"VULN FOUND\") //\"), with the initial characters of 1); being the breakout sequence to finish the current expression.\nHowever, this exploit fails. The problem is that once JavaScript executes the instruction return 2*(1); it ignores what comes next, as the return statement just finishes the execution of the current function.\nA successful exploit needs to inject the payload before closing the current expression, like so: evaluate('console.log(\"VULN FOUND\")) //').\nNote that the final argument to the Function sink in this case is return 2*(console.log(\"VULN FOUND\")) //). We close the parenthesis context right after the payload and before the comment\nstarts; otherwise an error would be thrown as the expression is syntactically invalid, as the open parenthesis would never be closed.\nPayload template\nWe now describe how the Enumerator constructs a target payload, which is the final string that will be passed to eval or the Function constructor.\nIt differs from prior work like NodeMedic in its ability to construct a final payload that obeys all syntactic constraints and execute the intended statement.\nThe Enumerator is given a prefix, such as return 2*( and outputs a number of alternative payload templates, each with a placeholder for an arbitrary statement to execute.\nA payload template is a list where each element can have one of the following types:\n\nLiteral: A constant string, usually with syntactic connectors (e.g. a parenthesis )).\nPayload: The placeholder for the payload.\nIdentifier: This is replaced with a valid variable name. It\nis important that the final JavaScript expression does not use\nundefined variables.\nFreshIdentifier: This is replaced with a valid variable\nname that was not used before, as some JavaScript expressions\nhave to use fresh variables.\nGetField: This is replaced with any valid attribute.\n\nAn example payload template that the Enumerator outputs for the package and prefix described above is: [Literal(\"return 2*(\"), Payload(), Literal(\")\"]. Next we discuss\nhow payload templates are generated with some technical detail, but the reader can refer to the paper for more details.\nGraph representation\nThe Enumerator internally uses a graph representation for JavaScript syntax.\nEach node is a symbol representing a JavaScript syntactic category, such as variable names and elements for the template described above.\nThe root is a node that represents the start of a new JavaScript expression. Collecting all symbols on a path from a node\nto the root yields a valid payload template, which together with the prefix string can be instantiated to a valid JavaScript program.\nThus the transition between node A and node B is only allowed if going to node B allows for a valid completion.\nUsing this graph, the Enumerator starts from the beginning of the prefix, searching for a node that matches the first symbol of the prefix.\nAfter finding it, it follows the transition based on the next symbol of the prefix until it finds the last symbol of the prefix. The Enumerator proceeds to use the graph edges to generate the template, performing a reachability analysis and outputing all paths that can reach the root of the graph from the\ncurrent nodes. Each path is a valid template to complete the prefix.\n\nFigure 3 - Section of the graph representation of JavaScript syntax used by the Enumerator\nIn the figure above, we show a part of the graph used by the Enumerator. Transitions from nodes are annotated with the constraints required to make such a transition syntatically valid.\nEvaluation\nOur experiments were deployed via Docker containers on two Ubuntu 20.04 VMs, each with 12 cores and 32GB of RAM.\nPackages were analyzed in parallel; one container per instance of NodeMedic-FINE analyzing a package.\nWe repeated this process with several variants of NodeMedic-FINE configured with key components disabled to evaluate the effect of each component.\nDataset gathering\nWe gathered all packages from npm with at least 1 weekly download, resulting in a dataset of 1,732,536 packages. From this set, we analysed all 33,011 packages that contained calls to one of our supported sinks. To the best of our knowledge this was the largest dynamic taint analysis of ACI and ACE vulnerabilities in the Node.js ecosystem to date.\nHow effective is type-aware fuzzing at uncovering ACE, ACI flows?\nWe ran our tool against the described dataset of 33,011 packages with calls to sinks.\n| Condition      | Extra                 | Missing               | Total | Exploited packages |\n|:––––––– | ———————:|:———————:|       |                    |\n| NodeMedic-FINE | -                     | -                     | 1966  | 597                |\n| –ObjRecon     | 37                    | 74                    | 1929  | 590                |\n| –Types        | 50                    | 195                   | 1821  | 596                |\n| NodeMedic      | 0                     | 1214                  | 752   | 246                |\nIn the above table we compare the results of running NodeMedic-FINE flow discovery mechanism against three variants:\n\n-ObjRecon - Object reconstruction disabled\n-Types - Fuzzer only generates strings\nNodeMedic - Equivalent to a replication of NodeMedic. Fuzzer is consequently disabled in this variant.\n\nWe show the number of extra and missing flows that each variant has relative to normal fuzzing in NodeMedic-FINE.\nWe also show the total number of flows found by each variant in the same dataset.\nEnabling the fuzzer increases the number of flows found from 752 to 1966, resulting in 1214 additional flows. Type-awareness in the fuzzer is responsible for finding 195 extra flows compared to a fuzzer that only generates strings. Disabling type-aware fuzzing yields 50 extra flows, 25 of which can be found by the full fuzzer with a longer timeout. The other 25 are lost due to a serialization problem when executing dynamically generated exploits with inputs of complex types.\nObject reconstruction contributed to finding 74 extra flows. These were cases where the packages required inputs to be objects having a certain structure. Disabling object reconstruction also allows the fuzzer to find 37 extra flows. The limited time budget for fuzzing causes this; 26 of these 37 flows can be found\nby the full fuzzer with longer timeouts while the remaining 11 cases crash after running out of memory.\nCoverage guidance that object reconstruction uses may lead the fuzzer away from generating inputs that trigger flows.\nFor example, in one case the package prints an error and does not call the sink if a certain attribute is present in the user input.\nThe object reconstruction mechanism will generate these attributes as coverage increases; however, the absence of those attributes is crucial for triggering the flow.\nThe fuzzer found a flow in this package when object reconstruction is disabled.\nWe also show the number of exploited packages for each condition. Note that when the fuzzer only generates strings, it can almost reach the number of packages exploited by the default condition even after losing 145 potential flows. This is because synthesizing exploits with non-string types is harder than strings.\nHigh-level fuzzer result\nType- and object-structure aware fuzzing uncovers 1,966 flows; 2.6x the flows of NodeMedic. Object reconstruction is necessary to find 74 flows and generating diverse types yields 195 more flows compared to generating only strings.\nIs synthesis with the Enumerator effective for confirming ACE flows?\nOnce we find a flow, we try to confirm it.\n| Condition      | Extra                 | Missing               | Total |\n|:––––––– | ———————:|:———————:|       |\n| NodeMedic-FINE | -                     | -                     | 55    |\n| –Enumerator   | 0                     | 7                     | 48    |\nThe table above shows how NodeMedic-FINE compares against a variant that does not use the enumerator. We report the number of extra, missing, and total ACE flows for which we could successfully synthesize a working exploit (i.e. we are able to leverage the vulnerability and execute an arbitrary JavaScript statement that prints a message to the console). The enumerator is responsible for increasing the number of ACE exploits from 48 to 55 (a 15% increase).\nAll 7 cases for which the enumerator contributed required a complex payload to be constructed, involving the insertion of the payload\nin the right place, escaping the necessary contexts at the right time and, in some cases, an extra suffix concatenated after the prefix and our payload.\nHere we focus on ACE exploits only. In the paper we show other interesting results like the ACI exploits and detail the limitations of our tool and future work.\nHigh-level enumerator result\nThe Enumerator helped NodeMedic-FINE complete the majority of real world prefixes that we found in ACE flows, increasing the number of total confirmed ACE flows by 15%\nConclusion\nWe implemented NodeMedic-FINE, an end-to-end infrastructure for automatic detection and confirmation of ACI and ACE flows in Node.js packages. Our system analysed 32,011 Node.js packages and automatically confirmed exploitable flows in 680 different packages. While our fuzzer component is significantly more effective than prior work at finding flows, the Enumerator helps us confirm exploitability of flows that were previously considered challenging.\nReferences\n[1] François Gauthier, Behnaz Hassanshahi, and Alexander\nJordan.

While convenient, this process raises significant privacy concerns: how can you discover mutual contacts without revealing your entire contact list to the messaging app's server?\nIn a standard implementation, the app might upload your entire contact list to the server to perform the matching, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized access. To address this issue, we need a solution that allows for secure contact discovery without compromising user privacy.\nOne approach is to leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), like Intel SGX, to perform these operations securely on the server. TEEs create isolated environments where code and data can be processed without being accessible to the rest of the system. This means that even if the server's operating system is compromised, the information inside the TEE remains protected.\nBy implementing an oblivious map inside a TEE, we can ensure that neither the app's server nor potential attackers learn anything about your contact list or which queries you performed. Being oblivious means that no information is revealed from the CPU's memory access patterns, making it an ideal solution for privacy-preserving applications.\nThis blog post explores our research on ENIGMAP [6], an efficient external-memory oblivious map designed for secure enclaves, offering significant performance improvements over previous work. ENIGMAP enables privacy-preserving contact discovery and other applications by protecting sensitive data and queries from unauthorized access even from the operating system of the machine where ENIGMAP is running.\nBackground\nBefore we can dive into the details of ENIGMAP, we first need to understand a few basic concepts, including sorted maps, background on TEEs, external-memory and oblivious algorithms.\nSorted Map\nIn ENIGMAP, our goal is to implement an oblivious sorted map. A sorted map of size \\(N\\) is a data structure that can store up to \\(N\\) key-value pairs and efficiently supports the following operations:\n\nGet(key) -&gt; value: Returns the value associated with the key, or None if the key was not set before.\nSet(key, value): Sets or updates the value of the key.\nDelete(key): Removes the key from the map.\nRangeQuery(keyMin, keyMax) -&gt; [(key, value)]: Returns all the key-value pairs in the specified range.\n\nA search tree, such as a B+ tree or an AVL tree, is typically used to implement a sorted map. Following previous work [5], we chose to use an AVL tree. 1\nAVL tree\nAn AVL tree of size \\(N\\) is a binary search tree with at most \\(N\\) nodes, and  the following properties:\n\n\nbinary tree - a tree where each node has a key, a value, and at most 2 children.\n\n\nsearch tree - the key of every node is larger than the key of every node on its left subtree and smaller than the key of every node on its right subtree.\n\n\nAVL invariant - the height of the two child subtrees of any node differs by at most one.\n\n\nThe maximum height of an AVL tree of size \\(N\\) is \\( 1.44 \\log_2 N\\), and  Search(key), Insert(key,value) and Delete(key) operations – with their standard semantic meaning – can be implemented 2 to only access \\( O(\\log N) \\) nodes by doing a binary search for key on the tree. 3\n\nFigure 2 - An example AVL tree. Each node is represented only by its key. To search for the key 26, we would touch the nodes on the path from the root: 42, 20, 27 and 26.\n\nTo implement a map using an AVL tree, Get, Set and Delete get translated to the equivalent operations on a binary search tree (Search, Insert and Delete), while RangeQuery can be implemented by Searching for KeyMin and iterating over the next values on the map until we hit KeyMax.\nOk. So we know AVL trees can be used to implement a map efficiently. Great! But, how can we hide the content of our queries from an attacker who runs the machine where the map is now?\n\nWell, this is where Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) come into play. Rather than trusting standard cryptographic assumptions like Computational Diffie-Hellman or the existence of one-way functions, we instead trust… Intel.\n\nTEEs and External Memory\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs), like Intel SGX, provide isolated execution environments for sensitive computations. They ensure that data and code running inside of a secure memory region called an enclave are protected from external tampering and observation, even if the operating system is compromised. However, TEEs come with limited secure memory, which poses a challenge for applications to handle large datasets securely.\n\nThe “Enclave Assumption” – code inside an enclave runs under the crash-fault model (it either runs the correct computation or crashes, without unexpected behaviors); all of its memory contents are encrypted and cannot be accessed by any other applications running on the same machine; and the speed of code execution is similar to if it was not inside of an enclave.\n\n\nTo manage datasets that don't fit in the TEE, data must frequently be swapped between the secure enclave memory - called the Enclave Page Cache (EPC) - and insecure external memory (RAM or disk). This swapping process, known as page swapping, can significantly impact performance due to the overhead of moving data in and out of the enclave, context switching, and the need to encrypt and decrypt data during these transfers. In fact, we manually measured the cost of external memory accesses (Figure 2) - in SGXv2 copying a page from external memory to the EPC is about 47x-80x slower than copying the same amount of data inside of the EPC.\n\nOptimizing the number of external memory page swaps is crucial for enhancing the performance of applications running in TEEs.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - Cost of PageSwap operation of 4KB relative to a MOV of 4KB inside of enclave protected memory. A page swap is about 47\ntimes more expensive than moving 4KB in memory within the enclave.\nThe costs are color-coded which shows the cost breakdown, blue is the cost of EWB/OCall. EWB - enclave write back (the mechanism used by the operating system to swap enclave pages), OCall - using SGX's OCall mechanism so the enclave application manually swaps pages.\n\nAdditionally, all the accesses to the external memory can be seen by the operating system and thus by an attacker running the server. Therefore, these accesses should not reveal any information about the client's queries. This is where oblivious algorithms come into play.\nOblivious Algorithms\n\nAn oblivious algorithm is an algorithm that doesn't leak any information about its inputs to an attacker that has access to a trace of the algorithm's execution.\n\n\nIn the context of TEEs there are 3 traces to consider:\n\n\nThe addresses of external memory accesses - when we need to access disk, the operating system can always see which disk pages we accessed without any physical attacks [3].\n\n\nThe addresses of every RAM access inside of the TEE protected memory - in SGX, it is still the operating system that manages memory pages; therefore the operating system can know at the page level which addresses were accessed [3,4].\n\n\nThe instruction trace - the list of executed instructions, since the way CPU fetches instructions is by reading RAM addresses [4].\n\n\nAlgorithms that are oblivious with respect to only 1) are typically called weakly oblivious or external memory oblivious; while algorithms that are oblivious with respect to 1), 2) and 3) are called strongly oblivious or simply oblivious algorithms.\nIn this blogpost we will focus on strongly oblivious algorithms. In this notion:\n\n\nAll the traces above are public. Only the traces of the CPU registers and CPU caches are private.\n\n\nThe limited enclave-protected memory is encrypted and accessible to the enclave, even though its memory access trace is public4.\n\n\nThe external memory is public, and therefore the enclave needs to encrypt data before moving it there.\n\n\nOblivious Algorithms in practice\nSo, how do oblivious algorithms look like in practice? Lets consider the following function:\n\n\nListing 1 - A non-oblivious version of the check_password function - based on the number of instructions executed an attacker can learn the size of the common prefix between CORRECT and input\nIn Listing 1, the attacker can infer how many initial characters of the input are correct based on the number of memory accesses that check_password used - therefore it is not an oblivious algorithm. To make it oblivious we can make the number of memory accesses independent of the input:\n\nListing 2 - An oblivious version of the check_password function - the memory access trace is now constant.5\nIf you are familiar with constant-time cryptography you probably noticed that this oblivious algorithm is in fact also a constant-time algorithm. These two notions are closely related - if an attacker knows the number of memory addresses accessed, then the attacker has the information needed for timing attacks.\nHowever, compared to constant-time algorithms - where we only need to care about the computation time being constant - the oblivious notion is stronger - we also need to make sure every single address we access does not leak any information. Even accessing a single array index can leak information about the data being processed:\n\nListing 3 - A non-oblivious array access\nWhen we call access_array_nonoblivious, we will access the memory address (A+i). If an the attacker can see every address we use, then the attacker can learn if two calls to this function have the same arguments. To protect against this, we could again rely on a constant time algorithm - by scanning the entire array every time we need to access a single index,making use of the Conditional Mov x86 instruction - CMOV(cond, target, value).\n\nThe CMOV(cond, target, value) instruction assigns value to target if condition is true, but always fetches target and value from memory, resulting in a constant memory trace.\n\n\n\nListing 4 - An oblivious array access via linear scan - this takes time6 \\( O( \\) MAX_SIZE \\() \\)\nWhile using a linear scan for each array access ensures obliviousness, it is highly inefficient - we need to transverse the whole array every time we want to access a single element. However, this kind of linear scan solution is used in practice, for instance, Signal used it along with other techniques to offer Private Contact Discovery.\nTo address this inefficiency, more sophisticated methods to hide which index of an array is accessed have been developed that no longer have a constant memory access trace, but instead a random-looking one, like PathORAM.\nPathORAM\nPath Oblivious RAM (PathORAM) [1] is an efficient protocol designed to hide the access patterns to an array of size \\(N\\). The key insight for PathORAM is that rather than doing a linear scan to create a constant trace, we keep dynamically moving data in unprotected memory, so that the memory access trace is indistinguishable from that of accessing random positions in the array - so nothing can be inferred about which indexes we are accessing from the memory access trace.\nInterface for PathORAM\nPathORAM provides a straightforward interface:\n\n\nPerforms a read or write operation (readOrWrite) on the specified address addr reading or writing to data. The position pos has information about where the specified address is stored and is updated for addr after each call to access. It is up to the callee to keep track of pos for each address7.\n\n\nIn PathORAM each address is assigned a random position in {0..N} that identifies where that address is stored in public memory (we will see how soon). This position is leaked after each access call; therefore after each access call, a new random position is generated for that address. (We will explain how to keep track of all the positions for a binary search tree in the next section - Oblivious Data Structures - for now, just assume there is a way to keep track of the position for each address)\nHow PathORAM works\nIn PathORAM, each array index is stored as a block:\n\nPathORAM has two major structures:\n\n\nStash - where we keep recently accessed blocks. The stash has a constant maximum size and is accessed using linear scans.\n\n\nORAM Tree (Figure 3) - an almost8 complete binary tree with \\(N\\) leaves where each node is called a Bucket and can have up to Z (typically Z=4) blocks of data. Whenever we access this tree, we will leak which nodes are being accessed in the trace.\n\n\nThe position mentioned in the PathORAM interface identifies a unique path from the root to a leaf in this tree. If an address has a given position, then its block can be stored in any bucket on the path corresponding to that position.\n\nFigure 3 - A visualization of PathORAM tree with Z=4 where path 2 - the path with all the buckets that could contain position 2 is highlighted.\nWhen we construct the ORAM, every address is assigned a random position, and is placed in some bucket in the corresponding path7. When the access operation is called, the PathORAM algorithm does the following steps:\n\n\nRead Path - Move, from the ORAM tree to the stash, all the blocks on the path identified by the original position of the address.\n\n\nGenerate new position - Generate a new random position for the address we just accessed.\n\n\nStash Operation - Do a linear scan over the stash to do the read/write operation on the address we want, and update its position.\n\n\nStash Eviction - Pick a random path, and try to obliviously move blocks from the stash to this path - without revealing how many blocks were moved and the locations they were moved to. After this operation, the remaining number of blocks in the stash is below a small constant with very high probability 9.\n\n\nProvided we can keep track of the positions in some way (see section Oblivious Data Structures), we can do the access operation in an ORAM of size \\(N\\) in \\( O(\\log N \\log\\log^2 N) \\) (non-private) memory accesses. 7\nLet's see now how can we keep track of the node positions for a binary search tree.\nOblivious Data Structures\nIn order to keep track of the positions of all the nodes in a binary search tree, we can use an insight from the Oblivious Data Structures (ODS) paper [2]:\n\nWe only need to store the position of the root node - since every operation in a binary search tree always accesses the nodes starting from the root of the binary search tree, we can store in each node the position of its two children directly (See Figure 4).\n\n\nThis works, since when we want to access the children of a node, we can generate ahead of time the new random position for its children and store it in the parent before actually accessing the children.\n\nFigure 4 - A visualization of the logical AVL tree and how it is mapped to the PathORAM tree. We only need to keep track that node 42 is in position 2. Its children (node 20 and 73) have their position information (2 and 7 respectively) stored inside node 42.\nThis insight from ODS was previously implemented by P. Mishra et al. in Oblix [5], where an oblivious AVL tree was used to develop an oblivious map. In ENIGMAP, we build on the insight from ODS to develop an oblivious AVL tree, with practical optimizations related to TEEs.\nENIGMAP\nOur main contributions with ENIGMAP are:\n\n\nIdentifying external memory accesses as an important cost of oblivious algorithms in TEEs (Figure 2).\n\n\nAn asymptotically and concretely faster strongly oblivious sorted map both in number of instructions executed as well as external memory accesses (section Main Query Optimizations).\n\n\nA faster initialization algorithm for oblivious maps, making it practical for large database sizes (section Fast Initialization Algorithm).\n\n\nSo, let's take a look at a few of the optimizations done in ENIGMAP!\nMain Query Optimizations\nOptimization 1 - Locality Friendly Layout for the ORAM tree\nTo improve the locality of data accesses, ENIGMAP leverages concepts from cache-oblivious algorithms and van Emde Boas (vEB) layout [8]. By organizing the ORAM tree in a cache-efficient manner, we reduce the number of page swaps needed to access a path, significantly improving access times10.\nWhen we want to access an AVL tree node, we need to call Access on the ORAM to get that AVL tree node (recall from Figure 4 that each AVL node is stored in the ORAM), and therefore we will have to read all the Buckets in the path where that AVL tree node is stored. In the external-memory these buckets will be stored in pages, which are read atomically, but typically can include \\(B\\) buckets.\nIf we were to store the buckets in heap layout - this is level by level left to right - we would have to read \\( log{N} \\) pages, since apart from the first few levels, all the buckets would end up in different pages (see Heap Layout in Figure 5).\n\nInstead, ENIGMAP uses a locality friendly layout11 - we find out the size of the largest ORAM subtree that fits in a page (its height is \\( \\lf log_2{B} \\rf \\) ) and store subtrees of that size together in the disk page (see Our Layout in Figure 5) . This optimization allows to only have to read \\( log{\\frac{N}{B}} \\) pages per ORAM access.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Comparison of Heap Layout with the Layout used in ENIGMAP considering B=3. Each triangle/rectangle represents a disk page. Red - pages read while accessing the same certain path. To read a given path ENIGMAP reads an optimal number of pages (3 in the example), while the Heap layout will read one page per bucket (5 in the example).\nOptimization 2 - Ensuring integrity and freshness with low cost\nAnother key optimization that comes from the locality friendly layout is that we can ensure integrity and freshness of data in external memory with almost no extra cost. Since we always access ORAM pages in a path from the root and each friendly-layout subtree corresponds to a disk page, we can build a Merkle tree of the friendly-layout subtrees. Each subtree is encrypted with AES-GCM, and stores the nonce of its children subtrees encryptions. The main application only needs to keep the nonce of the root subtree to ensure integrity and freshness.\n\nFigure 6 - Achieving integrity protection efficiently in external memory on a tree can be done with a Merkle-tree. The fact we have subtrees packed together allows us to have good nonce-size to data-size ratio.\nOptimization 3 - Multi-level caching + batching\nENIGMAP employs a multi-level caching scheme to optimize data access:\n\n\nPage-Level Cache: Outside the enclave, this cache reduces the frequency of page swaps from disk.12\n\n\nBucket-Level Cache: Inside the enclave, it caches frequently accessed data to minimize external-memory calls, specifically we cache the top levels of the ORAM tree to always be inside the enclave.\n\n\nAVL-Tree node Cache: This cache is specifically designed to optimize searches within the AVL tree. It is implemented by temporarily marking AVL nodes as sticky - these nodes should stay in the stash during eviction, until we mark them as non-sticky. If a node is sticky, we can just access it directly via a linear scan from the stash, without paying the ORAM overhead. We use this optimization in two ways:\n\nAVL tree top caching - the first few AVL levels during search can just be accessed via linear scan.\nAVL batched operations - when we do an AVL tree insertion, we need to do two passes over the same AVL path. In the first pass, we mark all the nodes we will have to access as sticky, so that on the second pass we can access them faster via a linear scan of the stash.\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to read about about further optimizations and how each of these optimizations impacts performance in our paper [6].\n\nFast Initialization Algorithm\nImagine we have a array of \\(N\\) key-value pairs, and want to initialize an oblivious map with them. The simplest solution (Naive Solution), would be to start with an empty map, and call Set(key, value) once for each key-value pair - this would cost us \\(N\\) AVL Tree insertions. We can do better!\n\nInstead of doing \\(N\\) insertions, we construct the AVL tree with all the values all at once.\n\n\nThis works in two phases:\n\n\nPhase 1 - we build the logical AVL tree nodes with the correct random positions assigned.\n\n\nPhase 2 - we place the nodes into the ORAM tree obliviously, using a PathORAM initialization algorithm.\n\n\nIn order to better understand our algorithm, we will go over it step by step with an example. For the sake of simplicity, we will represent each key-value pair in the initial array by its key:\n\nPhase 1 - AVL Tree Construction\nIn the first phase, our goal is to build the AVL tree, by assigning random positions to all the nodes, and correctly assigning children and storing the children's position on each node such that the AVL tree properties are preserved.\nWe start by obliviously sorting13 the array and assigning random positions to each node14:\n\nNotice that any sorted array represents an implicit binary search tree with the AVL property - doing a binary search on the array corresponds to traversing a binary search tree.\nSo now, we need to correctly store the children positions on each node:\n\nTo do so, we use the Propagate procedure - Listing 5. For our example, the propagate algorithm for our array should be called as Propagate(arr, 0, 7).\n\nListing 5 - Propagate procedure pseudocode\nPropagate will be called once for each node. Every time we access a node, we mark it as sticky it so it won't be swapped into external memory and then recurse on each child to get its position and keep updating the indices. This means each node will be transferred at most once from external memory, and at any given time we will only have at most \\(\\log N\\) nodes marked as sticky - since that is the maximum tree depth. Therefore, this algorithm will incur at most \\(N\\) external memory transfers.\nNotice that the memory access pattern is oblivious since it depends only on the length of the array, and not on the content of the key-value pairs themselves.\n\nApart from the initial sorting, each Phase 1 stage does a linear number of external memory accesses and computation steps.\nPhase 2 - PathORAM Initialization\nThe second phase of the algorithm is an ORAM initialization algorithm - we have the content of all the block, as well as randomly assigned positions for each block, and now we want to place them in the ORAM tree without leaking where each block is stored. We encourage you to read about it in our paper [6].\nFor now, let's take a look at the performance of ENIGMAP.\n\nResults\nIn order to evaluate ENIGMAP, we compare the performance of each map operation against two implementations:\n\n\nSignal's Linear Scan Solution - It does a linear scan of the whole database for a batch of \\( \\beta \\) queries, indexing each entry of the database on an hashtable built obliviously from the batch of queries.\n\n\nOblix [5] - The previous state of the art. It also uses an ODS-based AVL tree.\n\n\n\nExperimental Setup\n\nDatabase Size (N): We tested with varying sizes, up to 256 million entries.\nBatch Size (\\( \\beta \\)): Because Signal's solution is optimized to work with batches of queries, we introduce the parameter \\( \\beta \\) to define the number of queries in a batch. We used batch sizes of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 queries.\nSGX Setting: In this blogpost we report results for a large EPC size (192GB)15, on a machine with 256GB of non-EPC RAM. Please refer to our paper for other settings, such as a small EPC size (128mb).\nKey size: All the keys in the experiments have 8 bytes each.\n\n\nGet Latency\nWe analyzed the performance of doing batches of \\( \\beta \\) Get operations on each map implementation, in terms of latency and throughput.\n\nAt a database size of \\(2^{26}\\), ENIGMAP achieves a throughput speedup of 2x on Get queries, while maintaining a latency per Get of 0.45ms compared to Signal's 930ms and Oblix's 11ms.\n\n\nAt a database size of \\(2^{32}\\), ENIGMAP achieves a throughput speedup of 130x on Get queries, while maintaining a latency per Get of 2ms compared to Signal's 133000ms.16\n\nAsymptotics\n\nSchemePage SwapsCompute\nSignal\\( O\\left(\\frac{N}{B}\\right) \\)\\( O(N + \\beta^2) \\)\nOblix\\( O\\left(\\beta \\log^2 N\\right) \\)\\( O\\left(\\beta \\log^3 N\\right) \\)\nENIGMAP\\( O\\left(\\beta \\log_B N \\log N\\right) \\)\\( O\\left(\\beta \\log^2 N \\log \\log N\\right) \\)\n\nTable 1 - Cost of a batch of \\( \\beta \\) Get queries, on a map with N elements, page size B (key-value pairs) and EPC of size M (key-value pairs)\nExperimental Latency\n\n\nFigure 7 - Comparison of ENIGMAP and Signal on\nSGXv2. Enclave memory size is 192GB, RAM size is\n256GB. The vertical lines mark when ENIGMAP and Signal\nstart to incur RAM and disk swaps, respectively. Comparison with Oblix in our paper is done through relative comparison to Signal (refer to Figure 9 in [5])\nFigure 7 shows that:\n\nIn terms of latency (measured at \\(\\beta=1\\)), ENIGMAP always outperforms Signal (and Oblix).\nIn terms of throughput, for batch sizes of 10, 100 and 1000, ENIGMAP starts to outperform Signal at a database sizes of \\(2^{17}\\), \\(2^{22}\\), and \\(2^{25}\\), respectively. Signal's quadratic computation term on the batch size makes it perform worse with batches larger than the ones tested.\n\nIn our paper, we also analyze the query performance of Insertions and Deletions, as well as analyzing the same experiments with different EPC and external memory constraints.\n\nThe key takeaway is that for medium and large database sizes (larger than \\(2^{25}\\) entries), ENIGMAP's throughput always outperforms the linear scan solution, making clear the superiority of ODS for TEEs.\n\n\nInitialization\nWe analyzed how long it takes to initialize an oblivious map of \\(N\\) entries.\n\nAt a database size of \\(2^{26}\\), ENIGMAP's initialization takes 9.5h, a speedup of 18x compared to Oblix, but much slower than the few minutes Signal's needs to create an enclave and write the key-value pairs to enclave memory.\n\n\nInitialization - Assymptotics\nSchemePage SwapsCompute\nSignal\\( O\\left(\\frac{N}{B}\\right) \\)\\( O(N) \\)\nOblix\\( O\\left(\\frac{N}{B} \\log^2 N\\right) \\)\\( O(N \\log N) \\)\nENIGMAP\\( O\\left(\\frac{N}{B} \\log_{\\frac{M}{B}} \\frac{N}{B}\\right) \\)\\( O(N \\log N) \\)\n\nTable 2 - Cost of initializing a map with N elements, page size B (key-value pairs) and EPC of size M (key-value pairs)\nInitialization - Experimental\n\n\nFigure 8 - Initialization cost of ENIGMAP (Fast), compared to our implementation of Oblix's initialization and to the Naive Initialization - doing \\(N\\) insertions on the database\nFigure 8 shows that ENIGMAP's initialization outperforms Oblix's by 2-18x depending on the database size. This improvement in initialization time is crucial for making ODS practical for larger database sizes. However, at 9.5h for \\(N=2^{26}\\), ENIGMAP's initialization is still much slower than Signal's linear scan initialization, which only takes a few minutes since it only needs to create a large enclave and copy the key-value pairs there. 17\nResults Summary\nENIGMAP shows significant improvements in query performance, achieving faster throughput and lower latency compared to Signal's linear scan solution and Oblix's ODS-based AVL tree. Specifically:\n\n\nQuery Throughput: ENIGMAP consistently outperforms both Signal and Oblix. At larger database sizes, ENIGMAP achieves up to 130x speedup over Signal for Get queries. This makes it highly efficient for handling large volumes of queries in practical applications.\n\n\nQuery Latency: ENIGMAP maintains low latency per query, making it suitable for real-time applications. For example, at a database size of \\(2^{26}\\), ENIGMAP's latency per Get is 0.45ms compared to Signal's 930ms and Oblix's 11ms. This significant reduction in latency ensures quick response times for individual queries.\n\n\nWhile ENIGMAP excels in query performance, its initialization time is slower compared to Signal's solution. This tradeoff highlights that while ENIGMAP's initialization is slower, its higher throughput and low latency make it highly practical for applications where query performance is more critical than initialization time.\nApplications, Limitations and Open Problems\nENIGMAP's Oblivious Sorted Map has a broad range of applications:\n\nSecure Databases: A sorted map can be used to build databases that protect the privacy of user queries. This is especially relevant for sensitive data such as medical records, financial transactions, and personal communication logs.\nPrivate Contact Discovery: Similar to the use case implemented by Signal, ENIGMAP can help in securely finding mutual contacts without revealing the contact list to the server.\nCloud Computing: With the increasing reliance on cloud services, ensuring data privacy and security is paramount. ENIGMAP allows users to securely store and query data on untrusted cloud servers while maintaining the confidentiality of their access patterns. In this setting the external memory is no longer RAM or Disk, but the remote cloud server itself.\nMulti-party computations (MPC): MPC and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provide encrypted computations similar to Intel SGX, but rely on strong cryptographic primitives rather than trusting hardware vendors like Intel. In MPC, it is crucial for algorithms to be oblivious to prevent information leakage through data access patterns. Traditionally, maps in MPC have been implemented using linear scans or an online phase of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) or Oblivious RAM (ORAM). ENIGMAP can serve as an efficient implementation of online ORAM in MPC, offering significant performance enhancements.\n\nWhile ENIGMAP presents significant advancements, it also comes with certain limitations to address in future work:\nInitialization Time: The initialization time for ENIGMAP is slower compared to simpler solutions like Signal's linear scan. For large databases, this initialization time can be a bottleneck. Future work should explore how to minimize the initialization time of ORAMs/ODSs in the TEE setting; there is still room for improvement. In [7] we developed a TEE external-memory optimized oblivious sorting algorithm that significantly improves ORAM initialization time; however, even with this optimization, ENIGMAP's initialization is still significantly slower than Signal. Exploring using other types of BSTs instead of AVL, or improving the ORAM initialization can also help improve initialization time.\nMemory Overheads: The use of oblivious algorithms and PathORAM requires additional memory to store metadata, such as positions and encrypted blocks, as well a linear amount of fake metadata used to store fake blocks, which may be a constraint in memory-limited environments.\nExploring other BST implementations: In non-oblivious databases, typically B+ trees, AVL trees, skip-lists, or variations of them are used for indices. It would be interesting to explore in depth the tradeoffs between each of these solutions.\nOur code is available on github, as well as ongoing work on more efficient oblivious maps.\nFootnotes:\n1\nIn our research, we considered both AVL trees and B+ trees. We opted for AVL trees in ENIGMAP because previous work had successfully used them, and for the specific problems we were addressing, the key and value sizes were relatively small. If range queries were not required, a hash table could be a faster alternative to a search tree.\n\n2\nTo learn how each of the operations are implemented, the wikipedia page on AVL trees is a great starting point.\n\n3\nHaving a bounded height and number of nodes that are touched during an operation is needed so that the time it takes to do a query doesn't leak information about the query. Since the tree depth is at most \\( 1.44 \\log_2 N\\), we can make every Search operation always touch \\( 1.44 \\log_2 N\\) nodes, potentially accessing fake nodes after we found the key we were looking for.\n\n5\nWe need to use * instead of &amp;&amp; because in C++ the &amp;&amp; operator short circuits.\n\n4\nThe granularity of the public memory access trace for Intel SGX is typically at the page level (4KB pages).\n\n6\nBoth number of CPU instructions as well as number of memory accesses whose trace is public.\n\n8\nAn almost complete binary tree of size N is a binary tree with N leaves where all the levels except the last one are full. The last level should have the N leftmost leaves only.\n\n9\nThe failure probability is negligible in the stash size - the probability of the stash becoming larger than K after an operation is  \\( o(2^{-K}) \\) [1].\n\n7\nI suggest reading the PathORAM paper [1] for more details on why the stack size is kept constant, how initialization works, and the recursive ORAM technique used to keep track of the positions of all the addresses.\n\n10\nThis locality-friendly layout is useful also in the scenario where we don't have a disk, since it can also translate to RAM pages that don't need to be cached, or it can also make trees with smaller nodes fit in CPU cache lines directly.\n\n11\nThis is not the Embe Boas layout - we don't need to be cache-agnostic, since we know the page size for disk and SGX - and can even experimentally measure it, as you can find in our paper.\n\n12\nThis cache is not as useful in SGXv2/TDX, since all the RAM can be used as part of the enclave.\n\n13\nOblivious Sorting can efficiently be done on an array of size N in time \\(O(N \\log^2 N)\\) [7].\n\n14\nIf the key-value pairs are already sorted by key, we can instead just verify it using a linear scan.\n\n15\nThese larger EPC sizes have weaker security guarantees - EPC memory in RAM no longer has a freshness check, therefore the hardware TCB is no longer just the CPU, but all of the machine hardware instead. There has been a shift in industry interest towards larger enclaves sizes recently as they become available on cloud datacenters. The assumption of trusting the hardware is addressed by a “proof of cloud” - a cloud provider signs they are running the enclave and, since there is pottentially a huge economical loss if the cloud providers lies, developers can trust the hardware is not being tampered with. Since this is now a utility-based model, in large EPCs, trusting an SGX enclave will follow the Crash-Fault model is now risk management rather than an expected guarantee.\n\n16\nThe Oblix paper does not report results for database sizes over \\(2^{30}\\), but even using the time for \\(2^{28}\\), we achieve a speedup of at least 53x, which further increases with database size.\n\n17\nNot all hope is lost in terms of initialization time; from our ongoing experiments, we believe the initialization time for binary search trees can be further improved, if we move away from AVL trees.\n\nBibliography\n\n\nE.

For example, when you access a website, you need to first retrieve the website’s IP address from a DNS (Domain Name Service) server, so that you can talk to the website provider associated with that IP address. Unfortunately, this process discloses your browsing history to the DNS server. Similarly, submitting a query to a search engine exposes your search history to the search service provider. Despite efforts to develop privacy-preserving information retrieval services, those service providers often employ the same retrieval techniques as their non-private counterparts and just promise to keep the users’ records securely or delete them afterward. Nonetheless, these service providers are still susceptible to data breaches.\nIs there a way to completely eradicate the leakage of information during information retrieval?\nA natural attempt is to encrypt the queries, so the server cannot read the queries in plaintext. However, without seeing the query, how can the server locate the relevant information? It seems like we are now facing a dilemma.\nWhat is Private Information Retrieval (PIR)?\nPrivate information retrieval (PIR), first introduced by Chor et al. back in 1995, is exactly the formal abstraction of “retrieving public information privately”. It is defined as follows.\n\nDefinition (Private Information Retrieval Protocol): For simplicity, let’s assume there is only one server storing a database consisting of \\(n\\) integers, denoted by \\(X_1,\\dots, X_n\\). Now assume the client wants to learn \\(X_i\\). The client and the server then engage in an interactive algorithm, formally referred as a Private Information Retrieval protocol. At the end of the protocol, the client should learn the correct value of \\(X_i\\). Also, the protocol should provide query privacy: the server should learn nothing about the query index \\(i\\).\n\n\nAt first glance, it might seem impossible to design such a protocol. Don’t worry – there is at least a naive protocol satisfying the definition: given any query index \\(i\\), the client just downloads the whole database and reads \\(X_i\\) locally. This protocol is perfectly private: the server only knows that the client downloads the database and that is independent of the actual query. Nonetheless, this protocol is not practical – the computation and communication costs per query are both linear in the size of the database.\nPreviously, cryptographers focused on improving the communication cost of PIR. Most proposed PIR schemes rely on Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special type of encryption scheme that allows computation on the ciphertexts. HE essentially avoids the dilemma we saw before – the server can perform some form of computation on the encrypted query and somehow locate the necessary information for the client. Existing schemes already achieved \\(O(\\log n)\\) communication per query based on HE (e.g., OnionPIR and Spiral).\n\nAn unsolved issue is the computation cost. Even with the help of HE, the computation cost is still linear in \\(n\\). Such linear-computation-cost PIRs are not suitable for larger databases. For example, a typical DNS server contains several hundreds of gigabytes of records and it is over-costly if the server has to scan all the records for each query. Unfortunately, Beimel, Ishai and Malkin showed that in the classical PIR model, linear computation is inevitable. The intuition behind their lower bound is actually pretty straightforward – if the server does not touch any particular database entry during the query, the server knows the client’s query cannot be this entry. This at least leaks one bit of information.\nTo get around this lower bound and achieve sublinear computation cost PIR, we can resort to a powerful idea in computer science – preprocessing. Preprocessing PIR allows the client or the server to run some (possibly interactive) protocols before the query phase begins, and store some necessary hints in the client space or the server space. The client or the server then uses those hints to help with the online queries.\nBeimel, Ishai and Malkin first showed that preprocessing PIR can indeed achieve \\(O(\\frac{n}{\\log n})\\) computation cost per query. Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (and their follow-up work with Henzinger) further showed the computation cost can be improved to \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) per query. Nonetheless, these schemes are relatively complicated and remain in theory. Then, a natural question is:\n\nIs there a practical, and sublinear computation cost PIR protocol?\n\n\nPiano: Extremely Simple PIR with Preprocessing\nWe now introduce our work Piano (Zhou et al., IEEE S&amp;P 2024), an extremely simple and practical PIR scheme with preprocessing. It is easy to implement – the core idea can be implemented within 150 lines of Go code, and it is blazingly fast. Piano only takes 12ms to finish a query on a 100GB database, which is nearly 1000x faster than the previous best solution (Henzinger et al. 2022)!\nPiano starts with the following idea:\n\nDownloading the whole database for every query seems bad, but what if the client can just download the database once and prepare for many queries?\n\n\nThat is, the client downloads the database during the preprocessing (importantly, without knowing the following queries), computes and stores some sublinear size hints, and then deletes the database. The client then utilizes those hints to help with online queries.\nThis idea cannot scale to Internet-size databases (like Google search), for sure. However, for many medium-size databases, the idea is practical if we can build a streaming preprocessing. Streaming means that instead of downloading the database at once, the client can download a small portion of the database each time, locally update the hints, and delete that portion of the database from the local storage. One can imagine that this process is similar to watching a Youtube video – you do not need to download the whole video at once, but rather just dynamically fetch a piece of the video 30 seconds ahead. We indeed designed a streaming preprocessing algorithm, and given a database of size around 100 gigabytes, the cost will be similar to watching Youtube videos for several hours.\nPreprocessing\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the preprocessing for a database with 16 entries.\nWe now get to introduce some details about the preprocessing.\nWe split the \\(n\\) indices into \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) chunks of size \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) (see Figure 1 above).\nDuring the preprocessing, the client will store roughly \\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\) “random linear equations”, where the variables are the entries from the database. To generate one linear equation, the client samples one entry from each database chunk, resulting in \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) variables for one equation. The client computes the sum of those variables during the preprocessing. In the end, the client only stores the sum values and the random seeds used to generate the equations. In addition, the client stores around \\(\\log n\\) random entries for each chunk. Those random entries will be called the replacement entries.\nFinally, the equations and the replacement entries comprise the client’s hint, which takes \\(O(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)\\) storage space. The server does not store any hints.\nSince the client does all the preprocessing computation locally, the server cannot observe the preprocessing result. Moreover, as we mentioned before, the preprocessing is done in a streaming manner, so the temporal storage requirement is small: the client only needs to initialize the equations to zeros, download the chunks one by one, and accumulatively compute the sum values.\nHandling a Single Query\nNow let’s see how the preprocessing helps with the online query. We use the example in Figure 1. Assume the client is querying for \\(X_7\\). The client will first scan the local equations and look for the first equation that contains \\(X_7\\). Because of the structure of those equations, during the scanning process, the client only needs to regenerate the second index in each equation using the stored random seeds, and match the generated index against “7”.  The client will find the equation \\(X_1 + X_7 + X_{10} + X_{12}=Y_1\\) in the example. Since the client already stores \\(Y_1\\), which is the sum of these four elements, if the client can further learn the sum of \\(X_1 + X_{10} + X_{12}\\), it will learn the value of \\(X_7\\) by a basic subtraction. Unfortunately, the client cannot directly send the indices “\\(1, 10, 12\\)” to the server and ask the server to return the sum of \\(X_1 + X_{10} + X_{12}\\), because the server will immediately see that there are no indices from the second chunk and learn that the query must belong to the second chunk. This is an information leakage.\nLuckily, we can mitigate this information leakage easily – remember that the client additionally stores some replacement entries in each chunk. So instead of directly removing the query index from the equation, the client replaces the query index with a known replacement entry index in the same chunk as the query. In our example, the client can simply replace \\(X_7\\) with \\(X_6\\), and send the four indices “\\(1, 6, 10, 12\\)” to the server. The server should return the sum of \\(X_1 + X_6 + X_{10} + X_{12}\\) to the client, upon receiving the indices. The client can then compute \\(X_7\\) as in Figure 2.\nNote that this query leaks no information about the actual query: the server just sees four random indices and each one of them is just an independently random index within one chunk, given the fact that the server cannot see the preprocessing results. This query is also efficient: the client takes \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) time to find the equation, the server takes \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) time to compute the sum, and the communication cost is just \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) (sending the edited equation to the server).\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the online query.\nMultiple Queries\nTo amortize the cost of the preprocessing, we want to support as many queries as possible. Let’s first assume we need to support \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) random queries, which amortize the preprocessing costs to the same as the query costs, i.e., \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) computation and communication cost per query.\nThe main issue is that we cannot reuse the same preprocessed equation or the same replacement entry to handle two queries. Otherwise, it will cause privacy leakage. We also don’t want to deplete our equations and replacement entries. What should we do?\nIt is easy to handle the replacements: recall that we have \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) random queries and \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) chunks. With a classical balls-into-bins argument, there will be at most \\(O(\\log n)\\) queries in each chunk with high probability. So preparing \\(O(\\log n)\\) replacements per chunk is enough.\nIt is trickier to handle the equations. A not-so-oblivious observation is that we cannot just remove the consumed equation or replace it with a random backup equation, because it will skew the joint distribution of the remaining equations – doing so makes the current query less likely to appear in the remaining equations! The correct strategy is to replace the consumed equation with a random equation conditioned on the current query being included. We modify our preprocessing algorithm and add additional structural backup equations to facilitate this refresh strategy. We omit the details here due to space constraints and refer the interested readers to our original paper for the full description.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to support many adaptive queries and remove the “\\(\\sqrt{n}\\) random queries” restriction. First, to make the queries look random, we can require the server to randomly permute the database upfront and share the permutation seed with the client. As long as the client is not making queries that depend on the permutation, the queries can be viewed as randomly distributed. An experienced reader may notice that a malicious server may not necessarily permute the database correctly. In our paper, we proposed extra steps to ensure that a malicious server only hurts the correctness but not the privacy of the scheme.\nMoreover, to support more queries, the simplest way is to redo the preprocessing per \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) queries. We can do better by utilizing a pipelining trick, shown in Figure 5. During the online query phase for the first \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) queries, we simultaneously run the preprocessing for the next batch of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) queries. So when we finish the first batch of queries, we have already finished the preprocessing for the next batch of queries, and we can immediately start the next query.\n\nFigure 5: Illustration of the pipelining trick. We run the preprocessing for the next batch simultaneously with the online queries. Then, the whole protocol can have a one-time preprocessing and a continuous online phase.\nAsymptotic Metrics of Piano\nPiano’s asymptotic behaviors can be summarized as follows.\n\nSimplified Theorem. Piano is a PIR protocol with one-time preprocessing, and it supports a polynomially bounded number of queries, while having the following asymptotic behaviors:\n\nOne-time Preprocessing:\n\n\\(O(n)\\) communication;\n\\(\\tilde{O}(n)\\) client computation.\n\n\nOnline Query (per query):\n\n\\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) communication.\n\\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\) client computation;\n\\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) server computation;\n\n\nStorge:\n\n\\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\)  client storage;\nNo additional server storage.\n\n\n\nHere, \\(\\tilde{O}()\\) hides the polylogarithmic terms.\n\n\nNotably, Piano achieves nearly optimal time-space tradeoff: Corrigan-Gibbs, Henzinger and Kogan showed that in any preprocessing PIR scheme, if the client stores \\(S\\) bits after preprocessing and the online query time cost is \\(T\\), then \\(S \\times T \\ge \\Omega(n)\\). Piano achieves \\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\) client storage and \\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})\\) online time, which matches the bound except for a polylogarithmic factor!\n\nEmpirical Results\nWe tested Piano on a 100GB database containing 1.6 billion 64-byte records. We compared it to the previous state-of-the-art scheme SimplePIR (Henzinger et al. 2022). As shown in the following table, our scheme has a nearly 1000x improvement in terms of pure computation, and a 120x improvement in the end-to-end latency, while having advantages in communication and storage. Note that the streaming preprocessing only takes 45 minutes (8-thread parallelization).\nPianoSimplePIR\nEnd-to-end Latency12ms (computation) + 60ms (network)~11s\nEnd-to-end Communication220KB2.3MB\nStorage0.8GB1.2GB\n\nApplications, Limitations and Open Problems\nWe are now actively exploring potential applications of Piano. As we mentioned earlier, a private search engine is one of the most attractive applications of PIR,\nand we are indeed building such an engine based on the combination of an optimized version of Piano and graph-based search algorithms. Our preliminary results show\nthat this private search engine can handle a static database nearly the size of English Wikipedia.\nIt achieves search quality comparable to those non-private search algorithms and provides orders of magnitude of efficiency improvement over previous best\nsolutions, including Tiptoe and Coeus.\nSome other applications, such as private DNS query, remain more challenging. One of the main technical difficulties is that the database (e.g., the DNS records) is\nbeing updated frequently, which contradicts the assumption of Piano. Two recent works proposed possible solutions for updatable databases (Lazzaretti and Papamanthou, Hoover et al.), but it remains an open problem as how to design a truly practical updatable PIR scheme.\nAnother limitation of Piano is the lack of appropriate permission control since the preprocessing of Piano reveals the whole database to the client. Imagine we are designing a PIR protocol for a personal credit score lookup service. It is not acceptable for one individual to learn all others’ credit scores. It remains an interesting open problem to design a PIR scheme with proper permission control, which is required by many real-world applications.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/piano-private-information-retrieval/","title":"Piano: Extremely Simple, Single-Server Private Information Retrieval"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/precise-traffic-engineering/":{"body":"Data center networks are similar to large cities:\nthey are at massive scale, and there exist many available roads/paths between a pair of source and destination.\nTo move data from one place to another, we transfer data in chunks of bytes known as packets (roughly analogous to vehicles),\nwhich traverse one of the available paths.\nJust like what happens during rush hours—i.e., vehicles get congested on a road—packets\nalso suffer from congestion if too many of them end up taking the same path.\nCongestion leads to bad application performance since more time is needed to transfer data.\nTherefore, we want to route packets via different paths to avoid congestion.\nSince the paths have different capacity (analogous to the number of car lanes), the number of packets\nsent onto each path should follow some calculated split ratio, which we refer to as weight distribution, in order to achieve optimal load balancing.\nAt path intersections—i.e., where paths split or converge—a\npurpose-built network switching chip\nexists to forward packets to an assigned path following a calculated weight distribution.\nMore details about how a switch achieves this will be seen shortly.\nHowever, making packets precisely follow any given weight distribution is difficult because the switches have constrained hardware resources to support it.\nWhen packets are distributed imprecisely, we will observe negative outcomes such as load imbalance and congestion.\nA key challenge is the following: how can we achieve precise packet distribution given the constrained hardware resources?\nOur recent work addresses this challenge and achieves very high fidelity in following the distribution.\nIn this blog post, I will first describe how load balancing is implemented in switch hardware\nand then quantify the impact when the weight distributions are not followed precisely.\nFinally, I will explain our proposed approach and show how it mitigates the problem.\nTraffic engineering, switch hardware and precision loss\nThere are two types of elements in a data center network: end hosts and switches.\nThese elements are interconnected by network links in a hierarchical, multi-rooted tree structure, as illustrated in the top right portion of Figure 1.\nThe end hosts are colored, and switches are labeled as S1, S2, etc.\nA pair of end hosts with the same color might want to exchange some amount of bytes, say 100 GB (or simply 100G),\nwhich is called demand. It is simple to find a path to route one demand.\nBut when there are so many of these demands from various end hosts, routing becomes a complicated optimization problem.\nThis is because we also need to ensure that the load on each path is balanced.\nHence we rely on a technique called traffic engineering (TE) to solve this problem.\nThe goal of TE is to route all demands while achieving optimal load balancing.\nTE works as follows (shown in the top left part of Figure 1):\n\nWith a global view of the network, a TE controller collects demands from the network.\nNext, TE solves the aforementioned optimization problem using some linear programming algorithm on a powerful server platform.\nOnce the TE controller has found the optimized routing for these demands, it generates a TE solution that contains weight distributions for each demand.\nMore specifically, the TE solution provides a concrete plan for each demand, specifying which paths to use and what fraction of the demand to allocate to each path.\nThis TE solution is then forwarded to the switches, which are responsible for implementing the specified distributions.\n\n\nFigure 1: Top: A typical TE system in data center networks. Bottom: Weighted traffic distribution in switch hardware.\nTaking the red host pair in Figure 1 as an example, the TE solution specifies that the 100G red demand should be split as 62G and 38G across 2 ports on switch S3.\n(I will explain the strikethroughs in the figure shortly.)\nThis blog post focuses solely on how S3 implements this desired traffic distribution.\nHow the TE controller generates the TE solution or why the TE system works in this particular way is beyond the scope of this post.\nNow, let us zoom into S3 and try to understand how it works, as depicted by the bottom half of Figure 1.\nSwitches forward packets using two sets of configuration rules stored in their SRAM memory: destination rules and groups.\nA destination rule stores a pre-configured IP address and a pointer to a group.\nUpon receiving an incoming packet, the switch compares the destination IP address in the packet header with the IP address in each destination rule.\nIf the two addresses match, the packet follows the pointer in the rule to the corresponding group, which determines the packet’s next destination.\nA group is a data structure containing a set of egress ports.\nThe packet consults the group, which selects one of the ports uniformly at random as the egress port.\nFor packets destined for the red host, they are assigned to group G1, while packets bound for other hosts use different groups.\nTo approximate the desired traffic distribution, ports p1 and p2 are replicated 62 and 38 times within group G1.\nThis ensures that 62% of the packets will be directed to port p1, with the remaining 38% routed to port p2.\nHowever, a problem arises: these switches have very limited memory.\nMeanwhile, entry replication often consumes a significant amount of memory space.\nIn other words, the groups may not fit into the switch memory.\nUnfortunately, a straightforward solution of simply adding more memory proves difficult due to\na concept known as the power-performance-area tradeoff.\nOn-chip switch memory cannot be built to simultaneously achieve high read/write speed, large space and energy efficiency.\nWe thus have to seek other approaches.\nFor demonstration purposes, let us assume that there is only space available for 10 port entries.\nTo fit into this space, G1’s size needs to be reduced since it currently requires 100 entries.\nThe straightforward approach is to reduce the weights to 31:19, which is equivalent to 62:38 but smaller.\nHowever, this is still too large.\nAnother option is to adjust the weights and round them to 3:2.\nThis is advantageous because G1 now only consumes 5 entries!\nThe process of reducing groups to a smaller version is called group reduction.\nTypically, this is handled by a group reduction algorithm running alongside the TE controller.\nIt is important to note that the final weights of 3:2 would change the desired traffic distribution from 62G:38G (struckthrough in Figure 1) to 60G:40G (bold).\nThis creates a difference in link loads (i.e., the absolute volume of bytes placed on a link) between what the TE solution specifies and what is actually implemented on the switch.\nThis difference on a link is referred to as precision loss.\nWhile precision loss may seem detrimental, it is crucial to understand its impact on real-world networks, which will be discussed in the next section.\nPrecision loss in the wild\nA good metric for quantifying the impact of precision loss is link utilization.\nLink utilization reflects the aggregated load on a link as a percentage.\nIf the utilization exceeds the expected value, we know the link is overloaded.\nWhile it is trivial to assess the utilization of one link, how can we evaluate the network as a whole?\nThe answer is to examine the distribution of link utilization.\nSpecifically, we are interested in the common case (p50) and tail (p99 and max) link utilization.\nFigure 2 presents a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the utilization of all links\nmeasured from a large Google production data center.\nThere are two curves in the figure: the blue dashed curve reflects the inferred (ideal) link utilization if all weight distributions are faithfully implemented,\nwhile the red solid curve represents the actual link utilization after weight adjustments in group reduction.\nThe reality deviates significantly from the ideal\napproximately 15% of the total links exhibit utilization higher than the maximum ideal utilization by up to 5 times!\nConsequently, due to overloading caused by precision loss, the worst few links experience severe congestion.\n\nFigure 2: Link utilization of a large Google production data center network.\nWhile limited memory is the root cause of precision loss, it’s important to understand how limited memory affects precision loss in different ways.\nLet’s revisit the groups in Figure 1. The total space required depends on three factors:\n(1) the number of groups, (2) the number of ports per group, (3) the port weights.\nIt turns out that all these three factors, along with the switch heterogeneity, contribute to precision loss.\nI will discuss them one by one:\n\nNumber of groups.\nAs the network scales larger, the number of groups increases,\nresulting in less relative memory space per group.\nNumber of ports per group.\nThe TE solution sometimes requires using many ports in a group to ensure failure resilience.\nThis also enlarges the group.\nSkewed port weights.\nSome groups contain skewed weight distributions that are hard to reduce.\nFor example, consider a distribution like 99:1—this requires a total of 100 entries.\nSince 1 is the smallest possible weight value, it cannot be reduced further.\nTo make this group smaller, we have to reduce the weight of 99.\nHowever, the more we reduce it, the more precision loss occurs.\nHeterogeneity.\nData centers typically comprise switches from various generations, as illustrated in Table 1.\nOlder generation switches have memory that is 8 times smaller than that of the newer ones, making it more challenging to accommodate groups.\n\nTable 1: Switch hardware profile in a Google production network.\nSwitch generationMemory limit\nOld generation4096 port entries\nNew generation32768 port entries\n\nWe have just seen the impact of precision loss and its root causes.\nThe next section will explore how to minimize precision loss.\nTime for some new group reduction algorithms\nRecall that the focus of this work is to accurately map TE solutions to groups in switches.\nThe key to this task lies in an efficient group reduction algorithm.\nThe existing algorithm used in Google’s production network—called WCMP TableFitting—is inadequate in certain scenarios.\nWe have identified opportunities for improvement, thus proposing two new group reduction algorithms.\nSome of you might wonder: why two?\nIt is because each of the two algorithms focuses on a different aspect:\none algorithm (named Direct Reduction) aims to find the most precise weights possible;\nthe other algorithm (named Greedy Reduction) strives to achieve faster reduction speed by sacrificing some optimality.\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of how group de-duplication works.\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of how demand-aware resource allocation works.\nI will omit the technical details about the algorithms. Those interested can take a look at our NSDI paper.\nThe full implementation of our group reduction algorithms can also be found on GitHub.\nHere, let me just highlight the core ideas that power both algorithms:\n\n\nIdea 1: De-duplication.\nRecall that packets destined for different IP addresses are handled by different groups, as Figure 3 shows.\nBut what if these “different groups” actually appear identical?\nNamely, the groups contain the same set of ports, and the weights for each port are also identical.\nThis situation is not uncommon, especially after group reduction, where groups can become identical.\nIn such cases, de-duplicating these identical groups and reusing a single instance allows for a more efficient use of the limited memory space available in switches.\n\n\nIdea 2: Space allocation.\nGroups naturally handle varying amounts of network traffic (demands), as reflected by the arrow sizes in Figure 4.\nConsequently, their contribution to the overall precision loss differs.\nAllocating a large chunk of memory space to a group serving minimal traffic would be inefficient (see the demand-unware allocation example in Figure 4).\nTherefore, we require a form of performance isolation.\nOur idea is to divide the available memory space into multiple allocations,\nwith the size of each allocation proportional to the traffic volume of a group.\nIn other words, each group receives dedicated space based on its traffic volume.\nThis is illustrated by the demand-aware allocation example in Figure 4.\n\n\nThese simple techniques work surprisingly well. In the final section, I’d like to show you some evaluation results.\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate the proposed group reduction algorithms using FabricEval,\na traffic engineering evaluation framework developed specifically for this project.\nBoth the proposed algorithms and the current approach (WCMP TableFitting)\nare implemented inside FabricEval for side-by-side comparison.\n\n     \n          \n          Figure 5: Common and tail link utilization.\n     \n     \n          \n          Figure 6: Time to complete group reduction.\n     \n\nThe previous section has mentioned that WCMP TableFitting falls short in certain scenarios.\nHere is a set of results showing how the new algorithms reduce precision loss compared to WCMP TableFitting.\nFigure 4 displays the common case (p50) link utilization and tail utilization (p99 and max) in a\nlarge-scale production-like data center network. Instead of testing in a real\ndeployment, we model after a Google production network and evaluate with simulation in FabricEval.\nFabricEval allows us to run controlled experiments without interrupting user traffic.\nThe ideal (blue) bar represents the ideal link utilization without precision loss.\nWCMP TableFitting exhibits as much as 67% higher link utilization over the ideal case.\nBoth Direct Reduction and Greedy Reduction show no more than 7% higher link utilization than the ideal.\nOur algorithms reduce precision loss by 10x compared to WCMP TableFitting.\nPrecision loss is just one aspect of the story. Since these algorithms operate in an online environment, we also care about their speed.\nFigure 5 illustrates the time they take to complete reduction for a batch of groups.\nIt suffices to note that the evaluation covers a range of network scenarios, from common to rare, as listed on the x-axis.\nOne observation is that reducing a set of groups could take anywhere between a tenth of a second to hundreds of seconds,\ndepending on their complexity.\nCompared to WCMP TableFitting, Greedy Reduction runs 1-2 orders of magnitude faster.\nDirect Reduction, on the other hand, performs similarly to WCMP TableFitting.\nOf course, what I have presented above are just a few examples from a comprehensive set of experiments.\nMore information can be found in our NSDI paper.\nConclusion\nPrecision loss is an inherent problem when implementing traffic engineering with\nlimited switch memory resources. Large-scale heterogeneous data center networks\nhave exacerbated this problem. We propose two new group reduction algorithms that\ncan map original weight distributions in the TE solution to groups on the switch with minimal precision loss.\nEvaluation results show that our algorithms achieve significant improvements\nover the existing approach (WCMP TableFitting).\nOur algorithms reduce precision loss by 10x and run up to 10x faster than WCMP TableFitting under various network scenarios.\nAcknowledgements.

The goal of this algorithm is to “approximate” the value of a graph optimization problem called “maximum directed cut”, or Max-DICUT for short, and the algorithm operates in the so-called “streaming model”. After defining these terms, I will describe how we reduce the problem of approximating the Max-DICUT value of a directed graph to the problem of estimating a certain matrix, which we call the “snapshot”, associated to a directed graph; finally, I will present some ideas behind streaming algorithms for estimating these snapshot matrices.\nIntroduction\nTo start, we will define the particular algorithmic model (streaming algorithms) and computational problem (Max-DICUT) that we are interested in.\nStreaming algorithms\nMotivated by applications to “big data”, in the last two decades, theoretical models of computing on massive inputs have been widely studied. In these models, the algorithm is given limited, partial access to some input object, and is required to produce an output fulfilling some guarantee related to that object. Some classes of models include:\n\nProperty testing, where an algorithm must decide whether a large object either has some property \\(P\\) or “really doesn’t have \\(P\\)”1 given only a few queries to the object. Depending on the specific model, the algorithm may be able to choose these queries adaptively, or, more restrictively, the queries might just be randomly and independently sampled according to some distribution.\nOnline algorithms, where an algorithm is forced to make progressive decisions about an object while it is revealed piece by piece.\nStreaming algorithms, where an algorithm is allowed to make a decision about an object after seeing it revealed progressively in a “stream”, but there is a limit on the amount of information that can be stored in memory.\n\nThis blog post is concerned with streaming algorithms. In this setting, memory space is the most important limited resource. Sometimes, there are even algorithms that pass over a data stream of length \\(n\\) but maintain their internal state using only \\(O(\\log n)\\) or even fewer bits of memory! One exciting aspect of the streaming model of computation is that space restrictions can often be studied mathematically from the standpoint of information theory, opening an avenue for proving impossibility results.2\nNumerous algorithmic problems have been studied in the context of streaming algorithms. These include statistical problems, such as finding frequent elements in a list (so-called “heavy hitters”) or estimating properties of the distribution of element frequencies in lists (like so-called “frequency moments”), as well as questions about graphs, such as testing for connectivity, or computing the maximum matching size, where the stream consists of the list of edges. The common denominator between all these problems is that the “usual” algorithms might not be good streaming algorithms, whether because they require too much space or because they require “on-demand” access to the input data.\nConstraint satisfaction problems\nMany “classical” computational problems can be recast into questions in the streaming model. Here, we are interested in one class of problems that have been particularly well-studied classically, namely constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). These occur often in practice and include many problems one might encounter in introductory algorithms courses, such as Max-3SAT, Max-CUT, and Max-\\(q\\)Coloring.\nCSPs are defined by variables and local constraints over a finite alphabet. More formally, a CSP is defined by:\n\nA finite set \\(\\Sigma\\), called an alphabet; in the typical “Boolean” case, \\(\\Sigma=\\{0,1\\}\\).\nA number of variables, \\(n\\).\nA number of local constraints, \\(m\\), and a list of constraints \\(C_1,\\ldots,C_m\\). Each constraint \\(C_j\\) is defined by four objects:\n\nA number \\(k_j \\geq 1 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), called the arity, that determines the number of variables \\(C_j\\) involves.\nA choice of \\(k_j\\) distinct variables \\(i_{j,1},\\ldots,i_{j,k_j} \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\).\nA predicate (or “goal” function) \\(f_j : \\Sigma^{k_j} \\to \\{0,1\\}\\) for those variables.\nA weight \\(w_j \\geq 0\\).\n\n\n\nThe CSP asks us to optimize over potential assignments, which are functions \\(x : \\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\to \\Sigma\\) mapping each variable to an element of \\(C_j\\). In particular, the objective is to maximize3 the number of “satisfied” (or “happy”, if you’d like) constraints, where a constraint \\(C_j\\) is “satisfied” if the alphabet symbols assigned by \\(x\\) on the variables \\(i_{j,1},\\ldots,i_{j,k_j}\\) satisfy the predicate \\(f_j\\). The maximum number of constraints satisfied by any assignment is called the value of the CSP.\nSome examples of CSPs are:\n\nIn Max-CUT (a.k.a. “Maximum Cut”), the alphabet is Boolean (\\(\\Sigma = \\{0,1\\}\\)), and all constraints are binary and use the same predicate: \\(f(x,y) = x \\oplus y\\) (where \\(\\oplus\\) denotes the Boolean XOR operation). I.e., if we apply a constraint to the variables \\((i_1,i_2)\\), then the constraint is satisfied iff \\(x(i_1) \\neq x(i_2)\\). Max-\\(q\\)Coloring is similar, over a larger alphabet of size \\(q\\), with the predicate \\(f(x,y)=1 \\iff x \\neq y\\).\nIn Max-DICUT (a.k.a. “Maximum Directed Cut”), the alphabet is again Boolean, and the predicate is now \\(f(x,y) = x \\wedge \\neg y\\), so that a constraint \\((i_1,i_2)\\) is satisfied iff \\(x(i_1) = 1 \\wedge x(i_2) = 0\\).\nIn Max-3SAT, the alphabet is also Boolean, all constraints are ternary, and the assorted predicates are all possible disjunctions on literals, such as \\(f(x,y,z) = x \\vee \\neg y \\vee z\\) or \\(f(x,y,z) = \\neg x \\vee \\neg y \\vee \\neg z\\).\n\nBoth Max-CUT and Max-DICUT can be described interchangeably in the language of graphs, which might be more familiar. For Max-CUT, given an instance on \\(n\\) variables, we can form a corresponding undirected graph on \\(n\\) vertices, and add an edge \\(i_1 \\leftrightarrow i_2\\) for each constraint \\((i_1,i_2)\\) in the instance (with the same weight). Now an assigns each vertex to either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), and an edge is satisfied iff its endpoints are on different sides of the cut. (We can think of an assignment as a “cut” which partitions the vertex-set into two sets: one side corresponding to the variables \\(\\{i : x(i)=0\\}\\) and one for \\(\\{i : x(i)=1\\}\\).) For Max-DICUT, because of the asymmetry, we have to create a directed graph. We add an edge \\(i_1 \\to i_2\\) for each constraint \\((i_1,i_2)\\), and an edge \\(i_1 \\to i_2\\) is satisfied iff \\(i_1\\) is assigned to \\(1\\) and \\(i_2\\) to \\(0\\). (Similarly, an assignment is an “ordered” partition of the vertex into two sets, i.e., we have a designated “source” set and “target” set and they are not interchangeable.)\n\nFigure. A “dictionary” between the CSP and graph versions of Max-CUT and Max-DICUT. Each variable becomes a vertex, each constraint becomes an edge (directed in Max-DICUT, undirected in Max-CUT), and a Boolean assignment \\(x\\) becomes a “cut” of the vertices in the graph.\nNote that in these examples, the arity is a small constant (i.e., either \\(2\\) or \\(3\\)). What makes CSPs so interesting is that we can “build up” complicated global instances on arbitrarily many variables by applying predicates to “local” sets of a few variables at a time.\nFor various reasons, we are interested in studying the feasibility of approximating the values of CSPs (and not exactly determining this value). Firstly, the approximability of CSPs by “classical” (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms is a subject of intense interest, stemming from connections to probabilistically checkable proofs and semidefinite programming. But the theory of classical CSP approximations relies on unproven assumptions like \\(\\mathbf{P} \\neq \\mathbf{NP}\\). Space-bounded streaming algorithms generally seem very weak compared to polynomial-time algorithms, but this gives us the satisfaction of proving unconditional hardness results — and some CSPs still admit nontrivial streaming approximation algorithms. Secondly, it turns out that exact computation of CSP value is very hard in the streaming setting. Further, exact computation is hardest for dense instances, which is typical for many streaming problems, while approximation is, interestingly, hardest for sparse instances, i.e., for instances with \\(O(n)\\) constraints. This is because of the following well-known “sparsification lemma”, which reduces computing the value (approximately) for arbitrary instances to computing the value (approximately) for sparse instances:\nLemma (sparsification, informal). Let \\(\\Psi\\) be an instance of a CSP with \\(n\\) variables and \\(m\\) constraints. Suppose we construct a new instance \\(\\Psi’\\), also on \\(n\\) variables, but with \\(m = \\Theta(n)\\) constraints, by randomly sampling constraints from \\(\\Psi\\). Then with high probability, the values of \\(\\Psi\\) and \\(\\Psi’\\) will be roughly the same.\n(To make this lemma formal: For \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), if \\(m’ = \\Theta(n/\\epsilon^2)\\), then we get high probability of the values being within an additive \\(\\pm\\epsilon\\). In the unweighted case, “randomly sampling constraints” literally means that each constraint is randomly sampled from \\(\\Psi\\)’s constraints. It is possible to generalize to the weighted case assuming the ratio of maximum to minimum weights is bounded.)\nBecause of this sparsification lemma, in the remainder of this post, we will assume for simplicity that all CSP instances on \\(n\\) variables have \\(\\Theta(n)\\) constraints. (Note we are assuming they also have \\(\\Omega(n)\\) constraints. The algorithms we describe below will also work for \\(o(n)\\) constraints, but this case can sometimes be messier.)\nStreaming algorithms meet CSPs: Max-CUT and Max-DICUT\nIt is natural to ask whether streaming algorithms can use the local constraints defining an instance to deduce something about the quality of the best global assignment:\n\nKey question: How much space does a streaming algorithm need to approximate the value of (the best global assignment to) a CSP given a pass over its list of local constraints?\n\n&nbsp;\nThis question was first posed at the 2011 Bertinoro workshop on sublinear algorithms (see the sublinear.info wiki). In this section, we examine this question through the lens of Max-CUT and Max-DICUT, which are two of the simplest and most widely studied Boolean, binary CSPs.\nStreaming CSPs and Max-CUT\nFor the rest of this blog post, we adopt the “graph” language for describing Max-CUT and Max-DICUT. Thus, in the streaming setting, we are interested in algorithms for Max-CUT and Max-DICUT where the input is a stream of undirected edges (Max-CUT) or directed edges (Max-DICUT) from a graph, and the goal is to output an approximation to the value of the graph.\nNow, we turn to some prior results about streaming algorithms for Max-CUT and Max-DICUT. Recall that streaming algorithms are characterized by the amount of space they use. We will be interested in three “regimes” of space. We define these regimes using “\\(O\\)-tilde” notation: \\(g(n) = \\tilde{O}(f(n))\\) if \\(g(n) = O(f(n) \\cdot \\log^C n)\\) for some constant \\(C&gt;0\\). The regimes are as follows.\nLarge space\nWe use “large space” to refer to space between \\(\\Omega(n)\\) and \\(\\tilde{O}(n)\\). This space regime is sufficient to store entire input instances in memory! Thus, we can exactly calculate the value of instances once we see all their constraints, simply by enumerating all possible \\(2^n\\) global assignments. (Recall that the streaming model places no restrictions on the time usage of algorithms!)\nKapralov and Krachun (STOC’19) showed that for Max-CUT, this algorithm is the best possible: no algorithms using less-than-large space can get a \\((1/2+\\epsilon)\\)-approximation for any \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\). (\\(1/2\\)-approximation is “trivial” since every Max-CUT instance has value at least \\(1/2\\); indeed, a random assignment has expected value \\(1/2\\) in any instance.) However, the picture for Max-DICUT is much more complicated.\nMedium space\nWe use “medium space” to refer to space between \\(\\Omega(\\sqrt n)\\) and \\(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt n)\\). This space regime is important because the “birthday paradox” phenomenon kicks in:\n\nKey fact: Medium space is sufficient to store a set \\(S\\) of variables large enough that we expect that there are constraints involving at least two variables in \\(S\\).\n\n&nbsp;\nIndeed, suppose we have an instance \\(\\Psi\\) on \\(n\\) variables, we pick a random subset \\(S \\subseteq [n]\\) of \\(\\Theta(\\sqrt n)\\) variables, and we look at all constraints which involve at least two variables in \\(S\\). Each constraint has this property with probability roughly \\(\\Theta((1/\\sqrt n)^2) = \\Theta(1/n)\\), so by linearity of expectation, we expect roughly \\(\\Theta(1)\\) constraints to have this property.\nThis key fact implied the breakdown of certain lower bound techniques for problems like Max-DICUT which worked in less-than-medium space, and it is also the starting point for unlocking improved approximation algorithms for Max-DICUT once medium space is available, as we’ll discuss below.\nSmall space\nFinally, we use “small space” to refer to space which is \\(\\tilde{O}(1)\\). Surprisingly, a result of Guruswami, Velingker, and Velusamy (APPROX’17, based out of CMU!) showed that even in small space, there are nontrivial algorithms for Max-DICUT. Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy (FOCS’20) gave a variant of this algorithm with better approximation guarantees, which they also showed is optimal in less-than-medium space.4 These algorithms achieve nontrivial approximations in small space by using an important tool from the literature on streaming algorithms: the small-space streaming algorithm, from the seminal work of Indyk (2006), for estimating vector norms.\nMax-DICUT and bias\nThe work of Chou et al. left wide open the gap between medium and large space for approximating Max-DICUT. That is: Are there medium-space (or even less-than-large-space) algorithms which get better approximations than is possible in less-than-medium space? In the next section, I present our affirmative answer to this question, but first, I will introduce a further quantity we will need, which first showed up in this context in the work of Guruswami et al.\nGiven an instance \\(\\Psi\\) of Max-DICUT (a.k.a., a directed graph), and a vertex \\(i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\), let \\(\\outdeg_\\Psi(i)\\) denote the total weight of edges \\(i \\to i’\\), \\(\\indeg_\\Psi(i)\\) the total weight of edges \\(i’ \\to i\\), and \\(\\deg_\\Psi(i) = \\outdeg_\\Psi(i) + \\indeg_\\Psi(i)\\) the total weight of edges \\(i_1\\to i_2\\) in which \\(i \\in \\{i_1,i_2\\}\\). (These are called, respectively, the out-degree, in-degree, and total-degree of \\(i\\).) If \\(\\deg_\\Psi(i) &gt; 0\\), then we define a scalar quantity called the bias of \\(i\\):\n\\[ \\bias_\\Psi(i) := \\frac{\\outdeg_\\Psi(i) - \\indeg_\\Psi(i)}{\\deg_\\Psi(i)}. \\] Note that \\(-1 \\leq \\bias_\\Psi(i) \\leq +1\\). The quantity \\(\\bias_\\Psi(i)\\) captures whether the edges incident to \\(i\\) are mostly outgoing (\\(\\bias_\\Psi(i) \\approx +1\\)), mostly incoming (\\(\\bias_\\Psi(i) \\approx -1\\)), or mixed (\\(\\bias_\\Psi(i) \\approx 0\\)).\n\nFigure. Visual depictions of three vertices in a directed graph with biases close to \\(+1,0,-1\\), respectively. Green edges are outgoing and red edges are incoming.\nThis concept of bias, which relies crucially on the asymmetry of the predicate (and therefore has no analogue for Max-CUT), is the key to unlocking nontrivial streaming approximation algorithms for Max-DICUT. Observe that if e.g. \\(\\bias_\\Psi(i) = -1\\), then all edges incident to \\(i\\) are incoming, and therefore, the optimal assignment for \\(\\Psi\\) should assign \\(i\\) to \\(0\\).5 Indeed, an instance is perfectly satisfiable iff all variables have bias either \\(+1\\) or \\(-1\\). What Guruswami et al. showed was that (i) this relationship is “robust”, in that instances with “many large-bias variables” have large value and vice versa, and (ii) whether an instance has “many large-bias variables” can be quantified using small-space streaming algorithms. Chou et al. gave an algorithm with better approximation ratios by strengthening the inequalities in (i).\nRemark: While we will not require this below, we mention that the notion of “many large-bias variables” is formalized by a quantity called the total bias of \\(\\Psi\\), which is simply the sum over \\(i\\), weighted by \\(\\deg_\\Psi(i)\\), of \\(|\\bias_\\Psi(i)|\\). By definition, the total bias is equal to \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n |\\outdeg_\\Psi(i)-\\indeg_\\Psi(i)|\\), which is simply the \\(1\\)-norm of the vector associated to \\(\\Psi\\) whose \\(i\\)-th entry is \\(\\outdeg_\\Psi(i)-\\indeg_\\Psi(i)\\)! So the Max-DICUT algorithms of Guruswami et al. and Chou et al. use the small-space \\(1\\)-norm sketching algorithm of Indyk as a black-box subroutine to estimate the total bias of the input graph.\nImproved algorithms from snapshot estimation\nFinally, we turn to the improved streaming algorithm for Max-DICUT from our recent papers in (SODA’23, FOCS’23). Our result is the following:\n\nTheorem (Saxena, S., Sudan, Velusamy, FOCS’23). There is a medium-space streaming algorithm for Max-DICUT which achieves an approximation ratio \\(\\alpha\\) strictly larger than the ratio \\(\\beta\\) possible in less-than-medium space (and achievable in small space).\n\n&nbsp;\nThe various results on streaming approximations for Max-DICUT are collected in the following figure:\n\nFigure. A diagram of the known upper and lower bounds on streaming approximations for Max-DICUT. The exponents of \\(0,1/2,1\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis correspond to the small-, medium-, and large-space regimes; green dots are prior upper bounds, red dots are prior lower bounds, and the blue dot is our new upper bound. Of note, Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy showed that \\(4/9\\)-approximations are achievable in small space and optimal in sub-medium space, while Kapralov and Krachun showed that \\(1/2\\)-approximations are optimal in sub-large space (where in fact arbitrarily good approximations are known). Our new algorithm gives a \\(0.484\\)-approximation, lying strictly between \\(4/9\\) and \\(1/2\\).\nThe snapshot matrix\nTo present our algorithm, we first need to define a matrix, which we call the snapshot, associated to any directed graph \\(\\Psi\\). This matrix has the property that a certain linear combination of its entries gives a good approximation to the Max-DICUT value of \\(\\Psi\\) (a better approximation than is possible with a less-than-medium space streaming algorithm). Then, the goal of our algorithm becomes simply estimating the snapshot.\nThe snapshot matrix is simply the following. Recall that the interval \\([-1,+1]\\) is the space of possible biases of a variable in a Max-DICUT instance. Fix a partition \\(I_1,\\ldots,I_B\\) of this interval into a finite number of subintervals. Given this partition, we can partition the (positive-degree) variables in \\(\\Psi\\) into “bias classes”: Each vertex \\(i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\) has bias \\(\\bias_\\Psi(i)\\) falling into a unique interval \\(I_b\\) for some \\(b \\in \\{1,\\ldots,B\\}\\). Edges also are partitioned into biases classes: To an edge \\(i_1 \\to i_2\\) in \\(\\Psi\\) we associate class \\((b_1,b_2) \\in \\{1,\\ldots,B\\} \\times \\{1,\\ldots,B\\}\\), where \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are respectively the classes of \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\). The snapshot matrix, which we denote \\(\\mathsf{Snap}_\\Psi \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{B \\times B}\\), is simply the \\(B \\times B\\) matrix which captures the weight of edges in each bias class, i.e., the \\((b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry is the total weight of edges \\(i_1 \\to i_2\\) with \\(\\bias_\\Psi(i_1) \\in I_{b_1}\\) and \\(\\bias_\\Psi(i_2) \\in I_{b_2}\\).\nAside: Oblivious algorithms\nAt this point, we can “black-box” the notion of snapshot, since our algorithmic goal is now only to estimate the snapshot. However, to give intuition for the snapshot and show why it lets us achieve good approximations for Max-DICUT, we first take a detour into describing a simple class of “local” algorithms for Max-DICUT. These algorithms, called oblivious algorithms, were introduced by Feige and Jozeph (Algorithmica’17). Again, fix a partition of the space of possible biases \\([-1,+1]\\) into intervals \\(I_1,\\ldots,I_B\\). For each interval \\(I_b\\), also fix a probability \\(p_b\\). Now an oblivious algorithm is one which, given an instance \\(\\Psi\\), inspects each variable \\(i\\) independently and randomly sets it to \\(1\\) with probability \\(p_b\\), where \\(b\\) is the class of \\(i\\), and \\(0\\) otherwise. These algorithms are “oblivious” in the sense that they ignore everything about each variable except its bias.\nAs discussed in the previous section, in Max-DICUT, if a variable has bias \\(+1\\), we always “might as well” assign it to \\(1\\), and if it has bias \\(-1\\), we “might as well” assign it to \\(0\\). Oblivious algorithms flesh out this connection by choosing how to assign every variable based on its bias. For instance, if a variable has bias \\(+0.99\\), we should still want to assign it to \\(1\\) (at least with large probability).\nFeige and Jozeph showed that for a specific choice of the partition \\(I_b)\\) and probabilities \\(p_b)\\), the oblivious algorithm gives a good approximation to the overall Max-DICUT value. In particular, we realized the ratio achieved by their oblivious algorithm is strictly better than what Chou et al. showed was possible with a less-than-medium space streaming algorithm. (In a paper of mine at APPROX’23, I generalized this definition and the corresponding algorithmic result to Max-\\(k\\)AND for all \\(k \\geq 2\\).) Thus, to give improved streaming algorithms it suffices to “simulate” oblivious algorithms (and in particular the oblivious algorithm of Feige and Jozeph).\n\nFigure. The specific choice of bias partition \\(I\\) and probabilities \\(\\pi\\) employed by Feige and Jozeph to achieve a \\(0.483\\)-approximation for Max-DICUT. Here, these two objects are presented together as a single step function, with bias on the horizontal axis and probability on the vertical axis. This choice deterministically rounds vertices with bias \\(\\geq +1/2\\) to \\(1\\), \\(\\leq -1/2\\) to \\(0\\), and it performs a (discretized version of a) linear interpolation between these extremes for vertices with bias closer to \\(0\\).\nThe key observation is then that to simulate an oblivious algorithm on an instance \\(\\Psi\\), it suffices to only know (or estimate) the snapshot of \\(\\Psi\\). Indeed, every edge of class \\(b_1, b_2\\) is satisfied with probability \\((\\pi_{b_1})(1-\\pi_{b_2})\\) (the first factor is the probability that the first endpoint is assigned to \\(1\\), the second the probability that the second endpoint is assigned to \\(0\\), and these two events are independent). Thus, by linearity of expectation, the expected weight of the constraints satisfied by the oblivious algorithm is\n\\[ \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}_{x \\sim \\mathcal{X}}\\left[\\mathsf{Obl}(\\Psi) \\right] = \\sum_{b_1,b_2 = 1}^B (\\pi_{b_1})(1-\\pi_{b_2}) \\cdot \\Snap_\\Psi(b_1,b_2). \\]\nThe upshot of this for us is that to estimate the value of an instance \\(\\Psi\\), it suffices to calculate some linear function of this snapshot matrix \\(\\Snap_\\Psi\\). Another important consequence of this formula is that it allowed Feige and Jozeph to determine the approximation ratio of any oblivious algorithm using a linear program which minimizes the weight of constraints satisfied over all valid snapshots.6\nA medium-space algorithm and “smoothing” the snapshot\nAt this point, our goal is to use streaming algorithms to estimate a linear function of the entries of the snapshot \\(\\Snap_\\Psi\\). To calculate this function up to a (normalized) \\(\\pm \\epsilon\\), it suffices to estimate each entry of the snapshot up to \\(\\pm \\epsilon/B^2\\). \\(B\\) is a constant and so, reparametrizing \\(\\epsilon\\), we seek an algorithm to estimate a given entry of the snapshot up to \\(\\pm \\epsilon\\) error.\nRecall that the \\((b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry of the snapshot of \\(\\Psi\\) is the weight of edges in \\(\\Psi\\) with bias class \\((b_1,b_2)\\), i.e., the weight of edges from bias class \\(b_1\\) to bias class \\(b_2\\). To estimate this, we would ideally sample a random set \\(E\\) of \\(T = O(1)\\) edges in \\(\\Psi\\), measure the biases of their endpoints, and then use the fraction of edges in the sample with bias class \\((b_1,b_2)\\) as an estimate for the total fraction of edges with this bias class. But it is not clear how to use a streaming algorithm to randomly sample a small set of edges and measure the biases of their endpoints simultaneously.7 Indeed, this cannot be possible in small space, since we know via Chou et al.’s lower bound that medium space is necessary for improved Max-DICUT approximations, and therefore for snapshot estimation! In this final section, we describe how we are able to estimate the snapshot using medium space.\nAlgorithm for bounded-degree graphs\nFirst, suppose we were promised that in \\(\\Psi\\), every vertex has degree at most \\(D\\), and \\(D = O(1)\\). An algorithm to estimate the \\((b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry of the snapshot of \\(\\Psi\\) in this case is the following:\n\nBefore the stream, sample a set \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\) of \\(k\\) random vertices, where \\(k\\) is a parameter to be chosen later.\nDuring the stream, (i) store all edges whose endpoints are both in \\(S\\), and (ii) measure the biases of each vertex in \\(S\\).\nAfter the stream, take \\(E\\) to be the set of edges whose endpoints are both in \\(S\\). Observe that we know the biases of the endpoints of all edges in \\(E\\), and therefore the bias class of every edge in \\(E\\). Use the number of edges in \\(E\\) in bias class \\((b_1,b_2)\\) to estimate the total number of edges in \\(\\Psi\\) in this bias class.\n\nObserve that the expected number of edges in \\(E\\) is \\(\\sim m (k/n)^2\\) where \\(m\\) is the number of edges in \\(\\Psi\\). If \\(m = O(n)\\), then \\(|E| = \\Omega(1)\\) (in expectation) as long as \\(k = \\Omega(\\sqrt n)\\), which is precisely why this algorithm “kicks in” once we have medium space! 8 Once \\(S\\) is this large, we can indeed show that \\(E\\) suffices to estimate the snapshot. The proof of correctness of the estimate relies on bounded dependence of \\(E\\), by which we mean that in the collection of events \\(\\{e \\in E\\}_{e \\in \\Psi}\\), each event is independent of all but \\(O(1)\\) other events. Indeed, observe that since \\(\\Psi\\) has maximum degree \\(D\\), every edge in \\(\\Psi\\) is incident to \\(\\leq 2D-1\\) other edges. (Two edges are incident if they share at least one endpoint.) And for any two edges \\(e, e’ \\in \\Psi\\), the events “\\(e \\in \\Psi\\)” and “\\(e’ \\in \\Psi\\)” are not independent iff \\(e\\) and \\(e’\\) are incident.\nThe general case\nGeneral instances \\(\\Psi\\) need not have bounded maximum degree. This poses a serious challenge for the bounded-degree algorithm we just presented. Consider the case where \\(\\Psi\\) is a “star”, where each edge connects a designated center vertex \\(i^*\\) to one of the remaining vertices. In this situation, not every vertex is created equal. Indeed, if \\(i^* \\not\\in S\\) (which happens asymptotically almost surely), \\(E\\) will be empty, and therefore we learn nothing about \\(\\Psi\\)’s snapshot.\n\nFigure. An example graph with a highlighted subset of vertices \\(S\\) (green). Only edges with both endpoints in \\(S\\) are placed in \\(E\\) — in this case, there is only a single solid edge. All other edges are not in \\(E\\). There is a high-degree vertex (\\(1\\)) which we would ideally put in \\(S\\): since it is adjacent to so many other vertices, adding it to \\(S\\) would make \\(E\\) much larger.\nTo deal with this issue, the algorithm must become substantially more complex. We design the new algorithm to treat vertices of different degrees differently, giving “higher priority” to storing high-degree vertices, and it also captures more information than the above algorithm — in particular, it stores edges that have one endpoint in the “sampled set”, as opposed to both.\nOur new algorithm aims to estimate a more detailed object than the snapshot itself, which we call the refined snapshot of \\(\\Psi\\). To define this object, we also choose a partition into intervals \\(J_1,\\ldots,J_D\\) of the space \\([0,O(n)]\\) of possible degrees. (We only need that each interval has ratio \\(O(1)\\) between the minimum and maximum degrees it contains. For simplicity, we pick the intervals to be powers of two: \\([1,2), [2,4), [4,8),\\ldots\\).) This lets us define a unique degree class in \\(\\{1,\\ldots,D\\}\\) for every vertex, and a corresponding degree class in \\(\\{1,\\ldots,D\\}^2\\) for every edge. Now the refined snapshot is a four-dimensional array \\(\\RSnap_\\Psi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^2 \\times B^2}\\), whose \\((d_1,d_2,b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry is the number of edges in \\(\\Psi\\) with degree class \\((d_1,d_2)\\) and bias class \\((b_1,b_2)\\).\nNow, how do we estimate entries of this refined snapshot, i.e., estimate the number of edges in \\(\\Psi\\) with degree class \\((d_1,d_2)\\) and bias class \\((b_1,b_2)\\)? First, we sample a subset \\(\\Phi_1 \\subseteq \\Psi\\) of \\(\\Psi\\)’s edges, which I’ll call a slice, in the following way:\n\nSample a set \\(S_1\\) of vertices by including each vertex in \\(\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\) independently w.p. \\(p_1\\).\nSample a set \\(H_1\\) of edges in \\(\\Psi\\) by including each edge in \\(\\Psi\\) independently w.p. \\(q_1\\).\n\\(\\Phi_1\\) consists of edges in \\(H_1\\) with at least one vertex in \\(S_1\\).\n\nHere, \\(p_1\\) and \\(q_1\\) are two parameters that depend only on the degree class \\(d_1\\). We claim that a streaming algorithm can sample a slice (this follows from the definitions), and we observe that this slice can be stored in medium space assuming that \\(p_1 q_1 = \\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt n)\\), since \\(\\Psi\\) has \\(O(n)\\) edges and therefore \\(\\Phi_1\\) has \\(O(p_1q_1n)\\) edges in expectation. We repeat the above process to produce a second slice \\(\\Phi_2\\), with corresponding parameters \\(p_2,q_2\\), and then use the slices \\(\\Phi_1,\\Phi_2\\) to calculate our estimate of the snapshot.\nThe choices of \\(p_1,q_1,p_2,q_2\\) are delicate. Taking \\(p_1,q_1\\) as an example, if the highest degree in class \\(J_{d_1}\\) is constant, then we pick \\(p_1=\\Theta(1/\\sqrt n)\\) and \\(q_1 = 1\\), and our algorithm recovers the bounded-degree algorithm above. But in general, \\(q_1\\) is chosen so that vertices in degree-class \\(J_{d_1}\\) have expected constant degree in \\(H_1\\), which allows us to recover similar “bounded dependence” behavior to the bounded-degree algorithm and therefore get concentration in the estimate.\nBut still, how does the algorithm use the slices \\(\\Phi_1,\\Phi_2\\) to estimate the snapshot entry? Let \\(W_1\\) denote the set of “target” vertices in \\(\\Psi\\) which actually have bias class \\(b_1\\) and degree class \\(d_1\\). Similarly, define \\(W_2\\) as the “target” vertices in bias class \\(b_2\\) and degree class \\(d_2\\). The \\((d_1,d_2,b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry of the snapshot is then simply \\(|\\Psi \\cap (W_1 \\times W_2)|\\). Let \\(V_1 = W_1 \\cap S_1\\) and \\(V_2 = W_2 \\cap S_2\\). Suppose that the algorithm, in addition to the slices \\(\\Phi_1,\\Phi_2\\), received \\(V_1,V_2\\) as its input. Now note that for any edge \\(e = (v_1,v_2) \\in \\Psi \\cap (W_1 \\times W_2)\\), the event “\\(e \\in \\Phi_1 \\cap (V_1 \\times V_2) \\)” has probability \\(p_1 p_2 q_1\\), since the events “\\(v_1 \\in S_1\\)”, “\\(v_2 \\in S_2\\)”, and “\\(e \\in H_1\\)” are all independent. We could therefore hope to use \\(|\\Phi_1 \\cap (V_1 \\times V_2)|\\) to estimate the snapshot entry;9 indeed, (assuming that \\(d_1 &lt; d_2\\)) this turns out to be true, and the proof goes by first conditioning on \\(H_1\\), and then arguing that given \\(H_1\\), degrees are sufficiently small to imply bounded dependence of which edges are in \\(\\Phi_1\\) over the choice of \\(S_1,S_2\\).\nBut unfortunately, the algorithm does not get to see the actual sets \\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\). Instead, we have to employ certain “proxy” sets \\(\\hat{V}_1,\\hat{V}_2\\). To define these sets, observe that in the graph \\(H_1\\), for every vertex \\(v \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\),\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}_{H_1}[\\deg_{H_1}(v)] = q_1 \\cdot \\deg_{\\Psi}(v). \\] Thus, by just looking at the slice \\(\\Phi_1\\), we can estimate the degree of every vertex in \\(S_1\\). We can similarly estimate the bias, since\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}_{H_1}[\\bias_{H_1}(v)] = \\bias_\\Psi(v). \\] So, given \\(\\Phi_1\\) we can define a set \\(\\hat{V}_1 \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\) of vertices in \\(S_1\\) which appear to have bias class \\(b_1\\) and degree class \\(d_1\\), based on their estimated degrees and biases in the slice. \\(\\hat{V}_1\\) is an “estimate” for \\(V_1\\), and similarly we can define \\(\\hat{V}_2\\) “estimating” \\(V_2\\) using the second slice \\(\\Phi_2\\).\nSmoothing the snapshot\nThere is an additional complication caused by using “estimated” sets \\(\\hat{V}_1,\\hat{V}_2\\) instead of the actual sets \\(V_1,V_2\\): It is not improbable for there to be “extra” or “missing” vertices in the estimated sets. Suppose, for instance, there is a vertex \\(v\\) which is in degree class \\(d_1+1\\), but whose degree is close to the lower limit of the interval \\(J_{d_1+1}\\). Then \\(v\\) is by definition not in \\(V_1\\), but depending on the randomness of \\(H_1\\), it could end up in \\(\\hat{V}_1\\) with decent probability. This means we actually cannot estimate any particular entry of the refined snapshot with good probability!\nTo deal with this issue, we slightly modify the underlying problem we are trying to solve: Instead of aiming to directly estimate the refined snapshot, we aim to estimate a “smoothed” version of this snapshot, where the entries “overlap”, in that each entry captures edges whose bias and degree classes fall into certain “windows”. More precisely, for some window-size parameter \\(w\\), the \\((d_1,d_2,b_1,b_2)\\)-th entry captures the number of edges whose degree class is in \\(\\{d_1-w,\\ldots,d_1+w\\} \\times \\{d_2-w,\\ldots,d_2+w\\}\\) and bias class class is in \\(\\{b_1-w,\\ldots,b_1+w\\} \\times \\{b_2-w,\\ldots,b_2+w\\}\\). Each particular vertex will fall into many (\\(\\sim w^4\\)) of these windows, meaning that any errors from mistakenly shifting a vertex into adjacent bias or degree classes are “averaged out” for sufficiently large \\(w\\). Finally, we show that estimating the “smoothed” snapshot is still sufficient to estimate the Max-DICUT value using a continuity argument, essentially because slightly perturbing vertices’ biases cannot modify the Max-DICUT value too much.\nConclusion\nSeveral interesting open questions remain after the above results on streaming algorithms for Max-DICUT. Firstly, it would be interesting to extend these results to other CSPs besides Max-DICUT. For instance, we know of analogues for oblivious algorithms for Max-\\(k\\)AND for all \\(k \\geq 2\\), but whether there are snapshot estimation algorithms that “implement” these oblivious algorithms in less-than-large space is an open question. Also, there is a yawning gap between medium and large space. Proving any approximation impossibility result, or constructing better approximation algorithms, in the between-medium-and-large space regime would be very exciting. We do mention that the snapshot-based approach cannot give optimal (i.e., ratio-\\(1/2\\)) approximations for Max-DICUT because of another result of Feige and Jozeph, namely, a pair of graphs \\(\\Psi,\\Phi\\) which have the same snapshot, but the ratio of their Max-DICUT values is strictly less than \\(1/2\\).\nBibliography\nJ.

For instance, if the objects are graphs and the property \\(P\\) is the graph property of bipartiteness, “really not having \\(P\\)” might mean that many edges in the graph must be added or deleted in order to get \\(P\\) to hold.\n\n2\nThis is in contrast to more traditional areas of theory, such as time complexity, where many impossibility results are “conditional” on conjectures like \\(\\mathbf{P} \\neq \\mathbf{NP}\\).\n\n3\nIt is also interesting to study minimization versions of CSPs (i.e., trying to minimize the number of unsatisfied constraints), but that is out of scope for this post.\n\n4\nSpecifically, Chou et al. showed a sharp threshold in the space needed for \\(4/9\\)-approximations. The analysis of their algorithm was subsequently simplified in a joint work of mine with Boyland, Hwang, Prasad, and Velusamy in (APPROX’21).\n\n5\nMore precisely, there exists an optimal assignment with this property.\n\n6\nThis is an oversimplification: The goal is to minimize the approximation ratio (i.e., the value of the oblivious assignment over the value of the optimal assignment). However, Feige and Jozeph observe that under a symmetry assumption for \\(\\pi\\), it suffices to only minimize over instances where (i) the (unnormalized) value of the instance is \\(1\\) and (ii) the all-\\(1\\)’s assignment is optimal. Given (i), the algorithm’s ratio on an instance is simply the (unnormalized) expected value of the assignment produced by the oblivious algorithm, and (i) and (ii) together can be implemented as an additional linear constraint in the LP.\n\n7\nThis task is easier in some “nonstandard” streaming models. Firstly, suppose we were guaranteed that the edges showed up in the stream in a uniformly random order. Then since the first \\(T\\) edges in the stream are a random sample of \\(\\Psi\\)’s edges, we could simply use these edges for our set \\(E\\), and then record the biases of their endpoints over the remainder of the stream. Alternatively, suppose we were allowed two passes over the stream of edges. We could then use the first pass to sample \\(T\\) random edges \\(E\\), and use the second pass to measure the biases of their endpoints. Both of these algorithms use small space, since we are only sampling a constant number of edges.\n\n8\nTo avoid having to sample \\(S\\) upfront and store it, it turns out to be instead sufficient to use a \\(4\\)-wise independent hash function.\n\n9\nIt turns out to be important for the concentration bounds that we use the slice with smaller degree, e.g., if \\(d_1 &lt; d_2\\) then we count edges in \\(\\Phi_1\\). In this case, if we instead counted edges in \\(\\Phi_2\\), the expectation would be \\(O(p_1 p_2 q_2 m)\\), which could be smaller than \\(1\\) if \\(d_2\\) is very large.\n\n10\nMore precisely, for all \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) these algorithms output some value \\(\\hat{v}\\) satisfying \\(\\hat{v} \\in (1\\pm\\epsilon) \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_p\\) with high probability, and use \\(O(\\log n/\\epsilon^{O(1)})\\) space.\n\n11\nSee 8.\n\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/streaming-csps/","title":"Better streaming algorithms for Maximum Directed Cut via 'snapshots'"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/t2fpv/":{"body":"As AI technology advances, more and more autonomous robots are being tasked with\nnavigating among people in shared environments. Such applications span academia\nand industry, including sidewalk delivery robots, robotic museum\nguides, and automated room service in hotels.  In order to have robust,\nsocially-compliant navigation policies, these robots must be adept at predicting\npedestrian motion in busy environments.  In these environments,\nthe most natural setting for humans and robots is an egocentric, first-person\nview (FPV), where a camera is placed on the robot itself as it moves around, as\nhighlighted in the figure below:\n\n\nA Coco Delivery robot, having to navigate among humans.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of prior work in pedestrian trajectory prediction\ninstead relies on third-person sensing, where cameras are mounted\non infrastructure (such as rooftops) or on a stationary drone hovering\nabove the scene in order to record naturalistic behavior of humans.\nThese birds-eye view (BEV) recordings are then processed into datasets\ncomprising of ground truth examples for how humans navigate among each other, and\nused to train downstream trajectory prediction models.\nSo, why has this been the standard approach, and why is it problematic?\nBackground\nPedestrian motion prediction is important as it is used to inform a robot’s\nplanning module as to other peoples’ intents and likely paths. This is used not\njust to avoid collisions, but also to ensure social compliance—that is, moving\nin a way so as to not cause disruption, discomfort, or general inconvenience to\nhumans in the scene.\nWhile heuristic models, such as social forces, have long been utilized, the\nadvancement of deep learning techniques has dominated the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) [8, 9].  In these approaches, a machine learning model is\ntrained on a dataset of recorded human behavior as a form of static\nlearning-from-demonstration.  These datasets are considered trajectory datasets,\ncontaining at minimum the coordinates over time (or trajectory) of all people\n(or “agents”) in a given scene.  High quality dataset curation is thus paramount\nfor high quality model performance.\nA majority of existing datasets for this problem utilize a top-down perspective,\nsuch as the the ETH/UCY [1] collection of pedestrian datasets, shown below. One\nreason for this approach is the ease of annotation.  In a BEV perspective,\npeoples’ trajectories can be easily tracked in ground-plane coordinates over\ntime.  This is in stark contrast to FPV, where 3D segmentation and detection\nalgorithms are required to annotate observed pedestrians. Furthermore, using BEV\neliminates much of the occlusion problem, where people may be impossible to\nannotate when behind other people, buildings, or objects.  This occlusion can\nlead to tracking errors, like misassociation or losing somebody’s trajectory\naltogether, which can require data imputation to fill the missing values.\nTogether, these errors and noise from FPV sensing are denoted as “FPV errors”.\n\n\nETH/UCY dataset example in Hotel setting.\n\nAnother problem that the BEV perspective addresses is ensuring naturalistic\nhuman behavior.  To collect data in FPV, either robots or humans themselves have\nto wear cameras when navigating among others.  This can lead to several undesired\npsychological effects, such as the Hawthorne effect, where people’s behavior can\nchange when they know they’re being observed, as well as the novelty effect,\nwhere humans behave differently when first exposed to new technology [10].\nThus, while FPV datasets for pedestrian trajectory prediction exist, they\ncontain both FPV errors as well as no guarantees of naturalistic behavior in the\nfirst place.\nHowever, BEV data has a very serious flaw: in nearly all deployed\nsituations, a robot does not have access to top-down, perfect information of\nothers in the scene. Training a prediction policy which relies on having\nthis information, rather than having to deal with FPV errors, causes prediction\nmodels to be unrealistically effective, leading to a false sense of confidence\nin their abilities.\nOur Approach: Trajectories to First Person View (T2FPV)\nTo address the above limitations, we propose “Trajectories to First Person View”\n(T2FPV), a method for constructing an FPV version of data from a trajectory-only\ndataset.  This process entails starting with a BEV-recorded dataset and then\nperforming a high-fidelity simulation from each person’s FPV perspective. We use\nthis approach to generate, annotate, and release a version of the popular\nETH/UCY dataset in this new perspective.  Then, we conduct SOTA detection and\ntracking therein to get realistic partial perception from each person’s view. In\nthis setting, we observe the effects of FPV errors, and develop a module to\naddress them by refining the initial imputation of missing data in an end-to-end\nmanner with trajectory prediction.  This “Correction of FPV Errors” (CoFE)\nmodule decreases prediction displacement errors by more than 10% on average when\ncompared to all tested imputation and prediction approach combinations.\nConstructing an FPV Dataset\nWe begin by leveraging the SEANavBench [2] simulation environment, consisting of\nthe five high-fidelity pre-modeled locations, or “folds”, within the ETH/UCY\ndataset.  We then replay the recorded data by attaching a simulated camera to\neach pedestrian, requiring a few simplifying assumptions: pedestrians are all\nroughly the same height, using randomly selected human models, and also their\ngazes are aligned with the direction that they are moving in. We render videos for\neach person and output ground truth (GT) annotations at each frame, consisting of the\nlist of which other people are visible at any given time.\nNext, we conduct SOTA detection and tracking on these rendered videos, in order\nto emulate realistic perception which a deployed social navigation robot uses.\nWe employ an off-the-shelf object detector, DD3D [3], as well as a very\neffective probabilistic tracker [4]. We modify DD3D to improve performance on\nour specific task, such as altering the tracker’s matching metric and modifying\nthe feature map thresholds therein. As is common for ETH/UCY evaluation, we\ntrain one model for each of the five folds as a test set, using the other four\nfolds as training and validation in a leave-one-out manner.  Overall, we find\nthat this approach performs reasonably well on standard metrics including\nAverage Precision and Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy.\nFinally, we put together these outputs into an FPV dataset. We start with the\nstandard scene segmentation steps on ETH/UCY, where scenes are considered in a\nfixed-length, sliding window manner over the original data, and only scenes with\nat least two agents present at the same time are kept. These scenes consist of\n20 timesteps at 2.5 frames per second, where the first eight are kept as\n“history” and the next 12 are considered the “future” to be predicted. We\nutilize the Hungarian matching algorithm [11] to associate together the GT set of\nvisible agents (from our simulation annotations directly) with the observed set\nof people from detection and tracking. Where a given BEV scene has N people\nmoving around at the same time, we thus create N FPV variations of this scene,\nfrom each agent’s perspective. Importantly, these scenes contain FPV errors!\nThis entire process is highlighted in the figure below, showing how a single top-down scene\nproduces many first-person scenes. The heading titles such as “Sec IV-A” refer to sections in\nour reference paper, for further reading [5].\n\n\nT2FPV process overview; real-world top down trajectories are transformed to a first-person version in simulation, with limited (i.e., more realistic) perception.\n\nImproving Robustness to Perception Errors: CoFE\nAs discussed above, one key type of FPV error is that of missing observations in\nthe history portion of a trajectory due to detection and tracking errors.\nThis requires the imputation of missing data points for most trajectory prediction\nmethods. Although many prior works leverage simple imputation approaches like\nlinear interpolation and exponential smoothing, there are more sophisticated,\nSOTA deep learning imputation techniques such as NAOMI [6]. However, these\napproaches still rely on unrealistic assumptions, for human motion\nprediction: 1) data points are missing in a random manner; and 2) data points\nobserved around missing values can be trusted. The first assumption does not hold\nbecause data is missing pathologically due to errors in the perception system,\nwhereas the second fails because surrounding data points also incur positional\nestimation errors from perception.\nTherefore, we propose to incorporate a new module to sit in between the\nimputation and prediction steps of the pipeline, consisting of a neural network\ntrained end-to-end (E2E) with the downstream prediction model. This “Correction\nof FPV Errors”, or CoFE, module is similar to previous recurrent neural network\n(RNN) prediction approaches. The model first takes in an initial guess at\nimputation from an upstream method (e.g. NAOMI). Then, it proceeds in an\nencoder-decoder manner, where an encoder RNN builds a hidden state\nrepresentation of this input sequence. A decoder RNN then sequentially outputs\nrefinements of the trajectory, before passing it on to the trajectory\nprediction phase. To encourage this module to perform such refinements, a\nsimple mean-square error (MSE) loss objective is utilized, between the refined\nhistory track (i.e., the output of the decoder) and the ground truth associated\nhistory. The refined trajectory is used instead of the trajectory produced\ndirectly from the detection and tracking modules, to train both the CoFE module\nas well as the trajectory prediction model itself in an E2E fashion, along with\nthe original loss objective of the prediction model.\nThe full architecture is visualized in the figure below, with a deeper\ndiscussion of each component explained in our paper.\n\n\nCoFE module architecture.\n\nExperiments and Results\nWe implemented several representative approaches for the ETH/UCY trajectory\nprediction task, standing out along key techniques in human motion prediction:\nvariational prediction (VRNN [7]), social awareness (A-VRNN [8]), and goal\nconditioning (SGNet [9]). For data imputation, we also incorporate three\nrelevant approaches, including the commonly-used linear interpolation,\nexponential smoothing, and the aforementioned NAOMI deep learning method.\nWe utilized the standard leave-one-out evaluation methodology for ETH/UCY, where\none model is trained for each of the five folds and each imputation and\nprediction approach combination. We trained one version of the prediction\napproach with our CoFE module and objective, and one version without it.\nFinally, we used the standard metrics in the trajectory prediction task of\nAverage and Final Displacement Errors (ADE and FDE). These measure the L2-distance\nbetween the predicted future path and ground truth for the entire predicted\nportion and just the last time step, respectively. The table below summarizes\nour results, where the final column refers to the average of ADE / FDE\nrespectively over the five folds. As shown, all combinations of approaches\nperformed better with our CoFE module than without, by an average of more than\n10%.\n\n\n\nTo gain further insight into the behavior of CoFE, we conducted an ablation\nstudy and various qualitative analyses. In the ablation, we find that the E2E\ntraining is essential for the improved performance, as is the effect of only\nrefining the missing, imputed data points rather than surrounding observed\npoints as well. We include an example of the qualitative analysis below:\n\n\nQualitative example of CoFE effectiveness in improving predictions.\n\nIn this example, NAOMI by itself trusts surrounding points in the data too much,\nperforming a simple extrapolation. When paired with CoFE, the approach is more\neffective at capturing underlying patterns in the data, correcting the FPV\nerrors and resulting in better prediction.\nFuture Work\nWhile our T2FPV approach and CoFE module is effective, we note here some\npotential avenues of future improvements. Although the simulation platform we\nused, SEANavBench, is a high-fidelity environment, further effort in improving\nits realism would be useful. Realism could be enhanced not just by increasing\nthe 3D-modeling asset and animation qualities, but also by further improving\nalignment between the reproduced scenery and the original locations.\nAdditionally, for associating detection and tracking trajectories with their\ncorresponding GT tracks, we relied on Hungarian matching on our tracking output\ndirectly, which incurred a number of identity association errors.\nIncorporating recent works on affinity-based techniques for re-tracking\nalgorithms could be a promising way to help with this problem and even further\nreduce FPV errors. One further thread of research is to apply these\ntechniques to related domains where FPV sensing is required, such as autonomous\ndriving. While this related field has its own challenges, considering imputation\nand prediction together to account for sensing errors could be a promising\ndirection therein.\nConclusion\nIn existing work, pedestrian trajectory prediction has mainly been studied in an\nunrealistic BEV perspective. In this work, we introduce a more realistic\nfirst-person view trajectory prediction problem where agents need to make\npredictions based on partial, imprecise information. We present T2FPV, a method\nfor generating high-fidelity FPV datasets for pedestrian navigation by\nleveraging existing real-world trajectory datasets, and use it to create and\nrelease an FPV version of ETH/UCY. We also propose and evaluate CoFE, a module\nthat successfully refines imputation of missing data in an end-to-end manner\nwith trajectory prediction algorithms to reduce FPV errors. Therefore, we argue\nthat incorporating more realism throughout the perception pipeline is an\nimportant direction to move toward in enabling robots to navigate in the real\nworld.

Since SQL is declarative, users express the intended result of their query rather than the concrete procedural steps to produce the answer. Database management systems (DBMSs) find fast execution strategies for SQL queries using a component called the query optimizer (shown in Figure 1). The optimizer’s task is to search the space of equivalent query plans  (specific procedural strategies to retrieve the query result), estimate the number of rows produced by each operator (cardinalities), and select the plan with the lowest estimated runtime cost. After decades of research on query optimization, database systems have become remarkably effective at optimizing SQL queries.\n\n\nFigure 1, The Query Optimizer:\n\nThe query optimizer takes a SQL query (SELECT ...) as input and produces a query plan (shown on the right-hand side) as output. The query optimizer aims to select the query plan with the lowest estimated cost. It achieves this by enumerating the space of equivalent query plans (the plan space), estimating each operator's cardinalities, and estimating each candidate plan's runtime cost.\n\nUser-Defined Functions (UDFs)\nAlthough most database queries are written purely in SQL, billions of queries per day make calls to User-Defined Functions (UDFs), procedural functions written in non-SQL programming languages such as Python or PL/SQL.\n\n\nFigure 2, An example query invoking a PL/SQL UDF:\n\nThe query computes for each customer, their name, and whether they are a VIP.\n\n\n\nFigure 3, An Example UDF:\n\nAn example UDF written in PL/SQL. The function is_vip\ntakes a customer key as input and returns whether the customer is a VIP.\nA customer is a VIP if the total amount spent \non their orders (computed using the SELECT statement) exceeds 1,000,000.\n\nFigure 2 showcases an example query invoking a UDF (is_vip) from SQL,\nwith  Figure 3 providing the implementation of the is_vip UDF, which\nreturns whether a customer is a VIP. The is_vip UDF mixes declarative code\n(the SELECT statement) and procedural code (IF/ELSE statements). Allowing\nusers to mix procedural and declarative code provides a more convenient and intuitive way\nto express query logic than pure SQL. As a result, UDFs provide\nsignificant software engineering benefits\nto database users, namely the ability to reuse code, express query logic more concisely,\nand decompose complex queries into modular functions.\nRow-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) Execution\nUnfortunately, UDFs come with a performance cost. Unlike SQL, which is purely declarative, UDFs mix declarative and procedural programming paradigms.\nA DBMS’s query optimizer can effectively reason about SQL, but was never designed to optimize non-declarative UDF code.\nAs a consequence, DBMS’s execute UDFs as opaque functions (much like built-in functions), evaluating them in a naive “row-by-row” fashion.\nIn the process, SELECT statements embedded inside the UDF are re-evaluated\nfor each row, dramatically slowing down query execution. Database practitioners have\ntermed this naive, inefficient, row-by-row execution of UDFs as RBAR (Row-By-Agonizing-Row).\nFor the query shown in Figure 2, the DBMS naively evaluates the UDF for each input row of the customer table.\nEach UDF call executes an embedded SELECT statement that accesses the orders table.\nWithout an available index on the orders table, the DBMS scans the entire table on each UDF invocation.\nHence, the query’s runtime complexity is Θ(|customer| × |orders|), which is extremely inefficient. With an index,\nthe DBMS can avoid rescanning the orders table, but each UDF still incurs significant overhead, resulting in\ndegraded query runtime.\nUDF Inlining: Intuition\n\n\nFigure 4, UDF Inlining Intuition:\n\nThe key intuition behind UDF inlining is to translate UDFs from procedural functions into SQL subqueries,\na declarative representation that the DBMS can optimize effectively. In the above example, inlining replaces the is_vip UDF by an equivalent SQL subquery.\n\nThe DBMS employs RBAR execution of UDFs as they are written in a\nnon-declarative paradigm that the query optimizer cannot effectively reason about. Such row-by-row\nexecution is reminiscent of how database systems logically evaluate SQL subqueries,\nwhereby the DBMS re-evaluates a subquery for each row of the calling query. The key\ndistinction, however, between UDFs and subqueries is that the database community has\nspent decades optimizing subqueries.\nHence, if the DBMS could translate a UDF into an\nequivalent SQL subquery, the query is left entirely in SQL, which is amenable to\neffective query optimization. Translating UDFs to equivalent SQL subqueries is\nknown as UDF inlining, and enables the efficient execution of queries containing UDFs.\nSubquery Unnesting\n\n\nFigure 5, Subquery Unnesting:\n\nAn illustration of how DBMSs perform subquery unnesting. The SQL query is rewritten from\nan inefficient query containing a subquery to an equivalent query containing joins that are significantly faster to execute.\n\nUDF inlining avoids RBAR execution by translating UDFs into subqueries that the DBMS can unnest, replacing subqueries with equivalent join operators.\nOn the left-hand side of Figure 5 is a SQL query containing a subquery (shown in red).\nThe naive way of evaluating the query is by re-evaluating the subquery for each row of\nthe orders table and rescanning the customer table. Evaluating the query in\nthis manner results in a runtime of Θ(|customer| × |orders|), which is highly inefficient. The right-hand side of Figure 5 illustrates the rewritten query after the DBMS performs subquery unnesting, efficiently evaluating the query in Θ(|customer| + |orders|) time with hash joins.\nUDF Inlining: Further Details\n\n\nFigure 6, UDF Inlining:\n\nAn illustration of the UDF inlining technique for our motivating example.\nInlining translates the is_vip UDF into an equivalent SQL subquery with LATERAL joins. \nThe generated subquery is then \"inlined\" into the calling query.\nAfter inlining, the query is represented entirely in SQL, which the DBMS can optimize \neffectively.\n\nUDF inlining translates UDFs into equivalent SQL subqueries in three key steps. First,\ninlining translates a UDF’s statements to SQL tables. IF/ELSE blocks become\nCASE WHEN statements, assignments (i.e., x = y) become projections (i.e., SELECT y AS x).\nThen, the DBMS chains together these statements with LATERAL joins. LATERAL joins are special joins\nwhich allow the joining tables to reference each other’s columns. After inserting LATERAL joins, the resulting\nSQL expression is equivalent to the original UDF. The last step is to\n“inline” the generated SQL expression into the calling query, eliminating the UDF call.\nAfter applying UDF inlining, queries are represented in pure SQL, automatically\nimproving the performance of queries with UDFs by multiple orders of magnitude.\nThe Problem with UDF Inlining\nUnfortunately, UDF inlining is ineffective for most real-world queries because it produces large,\ncomplex SQL queries that are hard to optimize. In particular, to achieve significant performance improvements with UDF inlining,\nthe DBMS must unnest the generated subquery. Yet, UDF inlining produces complex subqueries containing LATERAL joins that most DBMSs fail to unnest.\nAs a result, the DBMS evaluates the subquery naively for each row, akin to the RBAR execution strategy used before applying UDF inlining.\n\n\nFigure 7, Subquery Unnesting (ProcBench):\n\nA table indicating whether a given DBMS (SQL Server or DuckDB) successfully unnested a UDF-centric\nquery from the Microsoft SQL ProcBench. A green tick indicates that the unnesting succeeded. A grey cross\n indicates that the unnesting failed.\n\nTo understand how effectively DBMSs optimize queries with UDFs, we ran the Microsoft\nSQL ProcBench, a UDF-centric benchmark containing 15 queries\nmodeled after real-world customer queries. We evaluated these queries on two DBMSs:\nMicrosoft SQL Server and DuckDB. A query executes efficiently only if the DBMS can\nunnest the subquery generated by UDF inlining otherwise the DBMS evaluates it RBAR.\nSQL Server unnests only 4 out of 15 of the queries after inlining. Alternatively stated,\nSQL Server evaluates 11 out of 15 of the ProcBench queries RBAR, resulting in underwhelming\nperformance. Hence, for most real-world UDF-centric queries, inlining is\nineffective on SQL Server. Although DuckDB supports\narbitrary unnesting of subqueries and achieves\nhigh performance on all 15 queries, only a handful of DBMSs implement arbitrary unnesting,\nand integrating the optimization into existing systems is highly challenging. Hence,\nfor the majority of UDF-centric queries, inlining is\nineffective for the vast majority of DBMSs (shown in Figure 8).\nOur Solution: UDF Outlining\nFundamentally, we observe that inlining entire UDFs results in complex subqueries that are challenging for the DBMS\nto unnest. Instead of inlining entire UDFs, a better approach is to analyze the UDF, deconstruct it into smaller pieces, and\ninline only the  pieces that help query optimization. To achieve this, we propose UDF outlining, an optimization technique\nthat extracts UDF code fragments into separate functions that are intentionally not inlined, minimizing UDF code complexity.\nWe implement UDF outlining in conjunction with four other complementary UDF-centric optimizations in PRISM, our optimizing compiler for UDFs (shown in Figure 9).\n\n\nFigure 8, PRISM:\n\nPRISM is an optimizing compiler for UDFs, deconstructing a UDF into separate inlined and outlined pieces. By operating on\nUDF pieces, only the code helpful for query optimization is exposed to the DBMS, intentionally leaving the remaining code opaque through UDF outlining. PRISM is reminiscent of a prism of light, breaking a UDF down into its constituent pieces.\n\nPRISM is an acronym for the five UDF-centric optimizations that it supports:\n\nPredicate Hoisting\nRegion-Based UDF Outlining\nInstruction Elimination\nSubquery Elision\nQuery Motion\n\nTo illustrate PRISM’s optimizations, we illustrate the changes that occur when applying the three relevant optimizations to our motivating example.\nRegion-Based UDF Outlining\nThe first and most critical optimization that PRISM performs is region-based UDF outlining. The goal of UDF outlining is to extract the largest blocks of unhelpful code\nfor query optimization into separate functions that are opaque to the DBMS. PRISM achieves this by representing a UDF as a hierarchy of program regions, where each region is eligible for outlining. PRISM identifies the largest regions of UDF code that do not contain any SELECT statements and extracts each\nregion into a separate outlined function. PRISM then compiles the outlined functions to machine code, preventing the inlining of the corresponding region. Lastly, PRISM replaces the\nregion in the original UDF with an opaque function call into the outlined function, simplifying the UDF substantially.\n\n\nFigure 9, Region-Based UDF Outlining:\nInstead of inlining the entire UDF, PRISM extracts the largest regions of non-SELECT code into separate outlined functions. In our example,\nPRISM extracts the IF/ELSE block and RETURN statement into an outlined function f(...), which is opaque to the query optimizer.\n\nFigure 9 illustrates how PRISM applies region-based UDF outlining to our motivating example. First, PRISM identifies the region containing the IF/ELSE block and RETURN statement as the largest region not containing SELECT statements. Next, it extracts the region into a new outlined function f(…), compiles it to machine code,\nand replaces the original region with an opaque function call to the outlined function. Through UDF outlining, PRISM significantly simplifies the UDF,\nenabling more effective query optimization.\nInstruction Elimination\nPRISM then applies instruction elimination, eliminating as many redundant instructions in the UDF as possible. PRISM achieves this by replacing a variable’s uses\nwith its definition, making the variable definition redundant. PRISM then deletes the definition.\nPRISM eliminates redundant instructions through instruction elimination, minimizing the number of LATERAL joins generated from inlining.\n\n\nFigure 10, Instruction Elimination: After UDF outlining, PRISM applies instruction elimination to remove as many UDF instructions as possible, reducing \nthe number of LATERAL joins from inlining. Instruction elimination replaces the uses of a variable with its definitions. In our example,\nPRISM eliminates the definition of total, directly forwarding its definition to the use by f(...).\n\n\nFigure 10 showcases PRISM’s application of instruction elimination to our motivating example. PRISM identifies total as a program variable\nand replaces its use in f(…) with its definition. Since total no longer has any uses, PRISM eliminates its defining instruction, collapsing the\nUDF to a single RETURN statement.\nSubquery Elision\nLastly, PRISM runs subquery elision to eliminate redundant subqueries from the resulting query. Inlining translates UDFs into subqueries, which complicates\nquery optimization. However, PRISM elides the subquery when a UDF consists of a single RETURN statement (as is the case for our motivating example, shown in Figure 11).\nInstead, it directly substitutes the original UDF call with the return value. PRISM simplifies the UDF through its optimizations,\noftentimes leaving the resulting query free of LATERAL joins, resulting in more effective query optimization and faster query plans.\n\n\nFigure 11, Subquery Elision:\nIn our example, PRISM reduces the UDF to a single RETURN statement after instruction elimination. When a UDF consists of a single RETURN statement,\n PRISM performs subquery elision and injects the return value into the calling query rather than substituting it as a SQL subquery.\n\nExperimental Setup\nWe performed our evaluation on a machine with a dual-socket 20-core Intel Xeon Gold 5218R CPU (20 cores per CPU, 2× HT), 192 GB DDR4 RAM, and a 960 GB NVMe SSD.\nWe use the default index configuration for all workloads and build additional column-store indexes on every table on SQL Server. For each DBMS, we tune their configuration\nknobs to improve performance, pre-warm the buffer pool, and refresh statistics. We perform two warmup runs of each query and then five hot runs (with minimal observed variance),\nreporting the average execution time of the five runs.\nSQL ProcBench: Microsoft released the SQL ProcBench in 2021 as the first UDF-centric benchmark modeled after real-world UDFs on Azure SQL Server. ProcBench is based on the TPC-DS benchmark and contains 24 queries that invoke scalar UDFs. We use a scale factor of 10 (a database size of ≈10 GB). We run 15 of the 24 queries, ignoring queries that use table-valued functions (TVFs) or UDFs invoked from stored procedures.\nExperiments: Unnesting\n\n\nFigure 12, Subquery Unnesting (ProcBench):\n\n A table indicating whether a given DBMS (SQL Server or DuckDB) successfully unnested a UDF-centric query\nfrom the Microsoft SQL ProcBench with a given technique (inlining or PRISM). A green tick indicates that the unnesting succeeded.\n A grey cross indicates that the unnesting failed. Figure 12 and Figure 7 share the same values for the queries unnested with inlining.\n\nThe principle issue with UDF inlining is that it produces complex subqueries with LATERAL joins\nthat most DBMSs cannot unnest, resulting in inefficient RBAR execution. By comparison, PRISM only exposes\nthe UDF pieces that improve query optimization, resulting in significantly simpler and faster queries.\nAs shown in Figure 12, SQL Server can unnest only 4 out of 15 of the ProcBench queries after applying UDF inlining.\nYet with PRISM, SQL Server can unnest 12 of the 15 queries, leading to efficient query execution with joins\nrather than inefficient RBAR execution. As expected, DuckDB can unnest all 15 queries with both techniques,\nas it supports arbitrary unnesting of subqueries. In summary, PRISM significantly improves\nsubquery unnesting compared to naively inlining the entire UDF.\nExperiments: Overall Speedup\n\n\nFigure 13, Aritmethic Mean Speedup (ProcBench):\n\nA table indicating the overall speedup on the Microsoft SQL ProcBench when running queries with PRISM over inlining the entire UDF.\nWe calculate speedup by dividing the runtime of running a given query without PRISM (i.e., inlining the entire UDF) by the runtime with PRISM.\nWe report the arithmetic mean speedup (excluding outliers) and the maximum speedup (including outliers). We observe that PRISM provides significant performance improvements over existing UDF optimization techniques.\n\nFigure 13 details the arithmetic mean (average) and maximum speedup of the ProcBench queries when running PRISM. We observe that, on average, PRISM attains a speedup of 298.7× due to 8 of the 15 ProcBench queries now evaluating efficiently with joins after successful unnesting rather than RBAR. The maximum speedup for SQL Server is 2997.9×, again due to more effective unnesting,\nfor a query that spends the entirety of its execution time in the UDF call. DuckDB can unnest arbitrary queries. Therefore, PRISM offers a more modest arithmetic mean speedup of 1.29× due to\neliminating LATERAL joins from the query plan. Lastly, PRISM delivers a maximum speedup of 2270.2× on DuckDB, as the query after UDF inlining is so complex, that even after unnesting, the DBMS picks an inefficient query plan with a large cross-product.  In contrast, the generated query is substantially simpler with PRISM,  leading to an efficient plan\nevaluated with hash joins. PRISM significantly improves SQL Server and DuckDB compared to inlining entire UDFs by generating simpler queries that are easier to optimize.\nConclusion\nThe database community developed UDF inlining to translate entire  UDFs to SQL for more effective query optimization. We observe that inlining entire UDFs leads to complex, obfuscated queries that are challenging for DBMSs to optimize effectively. Instead, we propose UDF outlining, a new technique that extracts regions of code irrelevant for query optimization into opaque functions intentionally hidden from the DBMS. In addition to UDF outlining, our optimizing compiler (PRISM) supports four other complementary UDF-centric optimizations.\nBy generating simpler queries, we observe that on the Microsoft SQL ProcBench, PRISM provides dramatic performance improvements over inlining entire UDFs.\nOur paper has been accepted for publication in VLDB 2025.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/udf-outlining/","title":"The Key to Effective UDF Optimization: Before Inlining, First Perform Outlining"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/understanding-setup/":{"body":"Why Understand Setup Times?\nSetup Times = Waiting + Frustration\nNobody likes waiting in line.\nBut some of the most frustrating experiences that I’ve ever had waiting are when I get in a super long line, I peek around to the front of the line, and I see that the server isn’t even ready to serve –they’re still setting up!\nIt’s terrible, and it happens everywhere:\n\nYou’re on break and you just want to log in to your favorite game, but “the system is experiencing unusually high load” and the login process is taking forever.\nYou’re at a cookout and you just want to grab a burger, but the grill is still heating up.\nYou’re dead-tired from being sick and you just want to grab your antibiotics and go to sleep, but the pharmacist has to go through an excruciatingly long badge-in process.\n\nThe frustrating part of these situations isn’t really the waiting per se ––kids learn to wait their turn in kindergarten.\nNo, the frustrating part is that you’re waiting and somehow it almost feels unnecessary; why weren’t these servers ready before this huge line formed in the first place?\nWhy do we spend so much time waiting for servers to set up?\nWhy we wait\nOf course, the answer to “why do we wait?” is the usual answer: because not-waiting costs money.\nIn basically all of these queueing systems, you could just have all of your servers running all the time.\nAnd if the only thing you cared about was how long people spent waiting, then of course you would just have all of your servers running all the time.\nBut keeping a server on costs money –even if that server is not actively doing work.\nThat’s why, in many queueing systems, instead of keeping their servers on all the time, system managers will actively scale the number of servers that are on in a dynamic way.\nIt turns out that if you do this “dynamic scaling” in the right way, then you can cut down on operating costs a lot.\nFor example, Google’s version of dynamic scaling, called Autopilot, was able to cut average resource waste in half, from 46% to 23%.\nAnd keep in mind that when we say “wasted resources,” we’re not just talking about wasted money –we’re also talking about unnecessary CO2 emissions and increased energy demand.\nWhy we (only sometimes) wait\nAlright, so then why doesn’t everyone implement the most-extreme version of dynamic scaling they can imagine, always keeping their system an inch away from being understaffed?\nWell, the answer is simple: nobody likes waiting, and if your customers have to wait for too long, then they’ll take their business elsewhere.\nIf you want to keep your customers while also conserving resources, you’ve got to balance waiting with wasting when you design your system.\nIn the best case scenario, you find a design sitting in that optimal sweet spot, where your system uses just enough resources to be sure that your customers don’t spend too long waiting.\nUnfortunately, we’re not even close to being able to find that sweet spot, since we haven’t been able to answer one of the most basic questions in this space: “How does the average waiting time behave in systems with setup times?”\nUnderstanding Setup: What we know\n\nSetup times hurt.\nSystems without setup have much, much lower delay than systems with setup. Simulation results with average job length of 1 ms, load of 0.5, and setup time of 100 ms.\n\nSetup times hurt.\nAt this point you might be wondering whether setup times actually hurt performance that much.\nThe short answer is: yes, in real systems, setup times hurt.\nThe longer answer is that the effect of setup times on a system is a complex interaction between 1) the length of a typical setup time, 2) the length of a typical service time (the average length of a job), 3) the total number of servers available, and 4) the arrival rate of jobs.\nIn real systems, where setup times are hundreds —even thousands— of times larger than service times, the average waiting time of a customer can be almost wholly determined by the system’s setup behavior.\n\nA multiserver system with setup.\nJobs (blue rectangles) enter into a central queue, where they wait in FCFS order until they are served by one of k servers (white circles with black outline containing 1 of 3 elements). Servers can be off (red “X”), on (blue rectangle), or in setup (green hourglass).\n\nBut understanding setup is hard.\nThat said, understanding how and why setup times destroy queueing performance has taken the better part of a century.\nFormal study began with Welch’s paper on “exceptional first services.”\nIn his study of single-server systems with setup times, he obtained a closed-form expression for not just the average waiting time, but the entire waiting time distribution!\nIn the multiserver case, little was known until the seminal 2014 paper of Gandhi et. al on “Recursive Renewal Reward.”\nIn their breakthrough paper, the authors develop and study a model of multiserver setup,\ndemonstrating that, given a number of servers \\( k \\), the average waiting time can be computed by solving a system of \\( O(k^2) \\) quadratic equations.\nSince then, all theoretical work on setup times has studied setup times using their model.\nHowever, even considering the Gandhi et. al  paper and all the work it spawned, we still don’t really understand setup.\nThe model they study is very much an approximate model: it assumes that setup times vary much more than they do in practice, which enables them to adapt a wide array of existing queueing analysis techniques to the setup time setting.\nUnfortunately, when setup times are large (and they are often thousands of times larger than the average job size), this assumption causes their model to dramatically underestimate the harm caused by setup times, especially when looking at larger systems.\nHowever, even after acknowledging that this model underestimates the harm due to setup, most setup researchers continue to use the Gandhi et. al  model.\nWhat makes setup hard?\nTo fully understand why the Gandhi et. al model is still in use, we first need to discuss what makes setup systems so hard to understand.\n\nSetup can be invisible.\nA comic illustrating the indirect nature of setup. In the first panel, the queue starts empty. Then, a job arrives triggering the setup of the server. While the initial job is waiting for the server to turn on, more jobs arrive, all observing the server in setup —the main cause of their delay. However, jobs which arrive after the server is on still experience additional delay —but do not directly observe why they are delayed.\n\nFirst reason: The setup effect can be invisible.\nThere are two reasons why setup is so hard to understand.\nFirst, the harm caused by setup times can be invisible.\nFor example, if I’m the first person in line when the pharmacist starts badging in, then I can directly see the reason why I’m waiting; I can observe the setup process.\nBut, while I’m waiting in line, other people will get in line behind me, and when the pharmacist finally finishes badging in, the line might be pretty long.\nAt that point, everyone in the line knows exactly why we have been waiting for so long: setup times.\nBut if another customer arrives after the pharmacist has finished badging in, then they’ll have no idea why the line is so long; the harm caused by setup times has become invisible.\nSecond reason: Servers interact.\nThe second hard-to-understand aspect of setup times only emerges when there are multiple servers in play.\nSetup gets more complicated in multiserver systems because now the work of one server can influence the setup behavior of another.\nFor example, suppose there are two pharmacists on hand, but only one is currently badged in and serving customers ––the other pharmacist is in the back, filling prescriptions.\nIf the line gets too long, the pharmacist in the back might think they need to start serving customers, and thus begin the long drawn-out badge-in process.\nIf, however, the already-serving front pharmacist somehow quickly works through the line, then it might not even make sense for the not-yet-serving back-pharmacist to complete the badge-in process; it might make sense for them to cancel their setup.\nNote that something like this would never happen if there was only one pharmacist, since, if there’s only one pharmacist and they’re currently badging in, there’s no way for the line to disappear (assuming everyone doesn’t abandon the line altogether).\nMore generally, if we scale up when the line is long and scale down when the line is short/empty, then the setup behavior of our servers becomes governed by how quickly the already-on servers are working;\nthis interaction between servers makes multiserver setup much, much more complex.\nWhere we went wrong before\nThe main issue with all the previous research on setup lies in how they dealt with this “interaction” complication.\nFor context, when studying complicated systems, reality is often way too hard to understand directly.\nIn order to make progress, researchers need to make simplifying assumptions about various aspects of their system.\nDone correctly, these simplifying assumptions can allow us to discard the unnecessary details of a system and draw meaningful conclusions about the parts that actually matter.\nThat said, if these simplifying assumptions are too unrealistic, then, even if we understand the simplified model well, the conclusions we obtain might end up meaning very little; this is exactly what happens in the previous model of setup.\nFirst issue: An unrealistic, but tractable model.\nAs we discussed, before our work, the state-of-the-art model of multiserver setup made a simplification that turns out to be too unrealistic.\nI mean “unrealistic” here in two different ways.\nFirst, the model behavior is unrealistic in the sense that its moment-to-moment behavior doesn’t seem to match what happens in reality.\nWithout going into too much detail, by assuming that setup times are distributed Exponentially, in the previous model, the speed of setup ends up scaling with the number of servers in setup.\nFor example, if 100 servers are setting up, the first few servers end up setting up ~100 times faster.\nIn real systems, this couldn’t be further from what actually happens: when you turn on a computer, it goes through a series of steps which takes almost the same amount of time, every time.\nThat said, plenty of useful models contain strange or unrealistic edge cases in their behavior; that, in and of itself, is not enough to prevent a model from being useful.\nSecond issue: Unrealistic behavior =&gt; Poor predictions\nHowever, although we could maybe ignore some unrealistic behavior, the second problem of prior work is much more serious: previous models vastly underestimate the harm caused by setup times.\nIn simulations, we’ve found that the average waiting time predicted by previous models can be orders of magnitude smaller than the true waiting time.\nAlthough the true waiting times and the previous model’s predicted waiting times are (relatively) close when studying small systems, the relative gap between these predictions rapidly widens as we increase the system scale.\nGiven that we don’t understand exactly how the size of this gap behaves, it’s extremely difficult to know when it’s actually alright to use the previous model.\n\nOur results match reality.\nA bar plot comparing the predictions of our approximation to the predictions of the Exponential model.  Our approximation is much closer to reality! Simulation results with average job length of 1 ms, load of 0.5, and setup time of 100 ms.\n\nHow our results change the game\nOur results change the game in three major ways: Compared to previous work, we 1) study a much more realistic model, 2) prove much stronger theoretical results, and 3) greatly improve upon the practical utility of existing work.\nLet’s describe each point in a little more detail.\nOur model is more realistic.\nFirst, let’s talk about how the setup process in our model is more realistic than in previous models.\nAs we noted before, there’s a big difference in performance between systems with and without setup times.\nBut previous models assume that setup times are distributed Exponentially, an assumption which leads them to dramatically underestimate the harm caused by setup times.\nIn particular, this Exponential assumption makes it so that, when more servers set up, the setup process happens faster.\nIn contrast, in our model, we make the setup time Deterministic: setup times take the same amount of time, every time.\nFor example, if booting up a single server takes a minute, then booting up 100 servers will also take a full minute.\nIn other words, we study setup times as they actually occur in real systems.\nOur results are stronger.\nSecond, our main results are stronger than most (if not all) previous results on multiserver setup.\nOur two main results investigate the average waiting time in our new, more realistic model.\nIn particular, we give both an upper bound and a lower bound on the average wait in our model, and also show that these upper and lower bounds differ by at most a multiplicative factor.\nMoreover, the bounds we derive are just explicit closed-form formulae; no additional computation is needed (see my thesis document for the details).\nWhile our results are enhanced by our more realistic model, these are also the first closed-form results ever for any finite-server system with setup times.\nOur results are more practically useful.\nThese bounds also give rise to our practical contribution: by combining the analysis of our upper and lower bounds, we also construct an easy-to-compute and extremely accurate approximation to the average waiting time.\nAnd while you’ll need to look at my thesis to see the full formula, this approximation goes beyond the state-of-the-art in three important respects:\n\nFirst, as we’ve already stated, our approximation gives extremely accurate predictions, whereas the previous state-of-the-art model underpredicts waiting times by orders of magnitude.\nSecond, our approximation is fast/cheap to compute. Since it is a simple rational function of the system parameters, it can be easily computed, even by hand. By contrast, in order to generate a single prediction, the previous state-of-the-art required one to solve a large system of quadratic equations.\nThird, our approximation gives intuition. As discussed, since our approximation is a simple formula, one can directly observe how and why the waiting time will increase or decrease in response to some alteration in the system parameters. On the other hand, it’s difficult to anticipate someone getting a lot of intuition from the previous state-of-the-art’s complicated system of equations.\n\nIn other words, our approximation is better, faster, and stronger. These three aspects of the approximation together make it much, much easier to design multiserver systems with both performance and efficiency in mind.\nConclusion\nGiven the above, you’re probably chomping at the bit to learn how we managed to prove such uniquely powerful results,\nespecially given that the model we study has Deterministic setup times, which are notoriously difficult to analyze with existing methods.\nUnfortunately, we don’t have time here to properly discuss the method that we developed to analyze our complicated Deterministic model.\nHowever, those interested will be able to find an in-depth description of the MIST method in my thesis document, available on my website after my defense.\nAnd don’t worry, it’ll definitely be posted by that day —no need to factor in setup times.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/understanding-setup/","title":"Understanding Setup Times"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/yoso-randomness-generation/":{"body":"Randomness is a fundamental component of numerous real-world protocols. It is used everywhere, from ensuring fairness in the green card lottery to its application in clinical trials, financial audits, and various blockchain technologies.\nFor these protocols, randomness must satisfy several key properties. First, it should not be possible to predict the randomness before it was generated, i.e., the randomness ought to be unpredictable. Second, no one should be able to bias this randomness, i.e., the randomness should to be unbiasable. Finally, many applications profit from randomness which can be seen by everyone, i.e., the randomness should to be public.\nCentralized randomness beacons, which emit unpredictable and unbiased random bits at regular intervals, have been thoroughly researched, from Rabin’s pioneering work\nin 1983 to the NIST beacon. However, centralized approaches can be undesirable due to their single points of failure. An alternative is to design a distributed algorithm where mutually distrusting parties collaborate to create a randomness beacon service.\nOur work focuses precisely on this alternative. We design distributed randomness generation algorithms which produce public, unpredictable, and unbiased random bits.\nOur Setting: YOSO with Worst-Case Corruptions\nTo obtain such a randomness generation algorithm, we are working in a model known as YOSO – You Only Speak Once, and specifically we consider \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\) – a version of YOSO with worst case corruptions. This model is tailored to the randomness generation setting and has been proposed by Nielsen, Ribeiro and Obremski at CRYPTO 2022.\nThe motivation behind this model is the following. Say we wish to have a long-running service which generates random bits. As this process runs over a long period of time, parties can join and leave the system at any point in time, subject to the constraint that at any point in time one party is online.\nIn more detail, we consider \\(n\\) parties which are executed one after the other. We assume that each party has its own internal source of randomness. We consider a computationally bounded adversary which is allowed to corrupt any \\(t\\) out of \\(n\\)\nparties before the protocol starts. Upon its execution, \\(P_i\\) can publicly broadcast a value \\(x_i\\) and send private messages \\(s_{i,j}\\) to each “future” party \\(P_j\\), i.e., any \\(P_j\\) such that \\(j &gt; i\\).\nDepending on when the adversary learns messages addressed to the corrupt parties, Nielsen, Ribeiro and Obremski distinguish between two different variations of \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\). In the following, we will work in the so-called execution-leaks \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\)model, where we assume that the adversary can see a value sent to a corrupt recipient upon the execution of this recipient.\nThe goal is to use the publicly broadcast values to extract a public, unpredictable, and unbiased random bit \\(r\\). See the picture below for a visual representation of this model.\n\nStrawman Solution\nHow can we obtain an unpredictable and unbiased random bit in the setting above? The first naive idea is to use a well-known commit-and-reveal paradigm. Briefly, this notion utilizes a commitment scheme, which is a cryptographic building block that allows a party to commit to a value, and later provide an opening information which in particular reveals the committed value. Security properties of such schemes ensure that until the commitment is opened, the committed value is hidden. At the same time, it is hard to open the commitment to two different values, i.e., the commitment provides binding. Think of it as putting a message in a box, locking the box and handing it to the receiver, and later giving this receiver the box key.\nIn our strawman solution we use \\(t+1\\) parties (dealers in the following), each of which is contributing randomness in a way that the randomness is hidden from the others at first. Another \\(2t+1\\) parties (receivers) will be helping to reveal the contributions of the first parties at the right time. Specifically, we let each dealer commit to a random value \\(r_i\\) and send its opening to every receiver. After all dealers have finished the execution, each receiver simply reveals the opening information it got from each dealer. See the picture below for an example where  \\(t=2\\).\n\nWe call a dealer valid if the majority of the receivers, i.e., \\(t+1\\) of them, revealed a value that is consistent with a commitment. Let \\(V\\) denote the index set of valid dealers. We set the output randomness as the xor of all \\(r_i\\) that were submitted by valid dealers: \\[ r = \\bigoplus_{i \\in V} r_i \\]\nIn the example above, say that all parties are honest and \\(r_1 = 1\\), \\(r_2 = 0\\), and \\(r_3 = 1\\). As all dealers are honest, every dealer sends correct openings to each receiver, and as each receiver is honest too,\nevery opening information is published and every dealer is deemed valid. Thus, after the receivers reveal the openings the output is set to be \\(r=r_1 \\oplus r_2 \\oplus r_3 = 0\\).\nOne could think that this is secure, as \\(t+1\\) honest receivers will always output the correct value for each receiver, hence honest dealers’ values are always counted in the outcome. Further, since there is at least one honest dealer among the \\(t+1\\), the resulting xor is computed using at least one unbiased random value. This value was further hidden before we started with the reconstruction. Surely, this is enough to achieve security?\nUnfortunately, this intuition is not entirely correct. For simplicity, say we focus on generating a single random bit, i.e, every dealer will commit to either a zero or one. While it is true that all honest dealers’ values are taken into account, a coalition of a dealer and a receiver, say \\(D_1\\) and \\(R_5\\), can conduct the following attack: A malicious dealer \\(D_1\\) commits to bit one, just as in the honest example above, but sends the correct opening only to exactly \\(t\\) receivers (not including the colluding receiver), for example \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\). Thus, \\(t\\) honest receivers (\\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in our example) will open the correct value, while another \\(t\\) honest receivers (\\(R_3\\) and \\(R_4\\)) won’t open anything for this dealer. Thus, the contribution of only honest receivers is just not enough to deem the malicious dealer valid (recall that \\(t+1\\) valid opening are required). Further, note that every receiver knows the contribution of all honest parties. This means that the colluding receiver knows the outcome of the coin and can decide whether to open the correct value for the colluding dealer or not, thus flipping the xor outcome if needed! In our example, \\(R_5\\) knows \\(r_1, r_2,\\) and \\(r_3\\). Upon its execution, it could chose to reveal the correct opening for \\(D_1\\), thus making the outcome to be \\(r=r_1 \\oplus r_2 \\oplus r_3 = 0\\), just as in the honest example. However, if \\(D_1\\) and \\(R_5\\) prefer the outcome to be \\(1\\), \\(R_5\\) simply withholds the opening for \\(D_1\\). Now, \\(D_1\\) is not considered valid anymore and the outcome becomes  \\(r=r_2 \\oplus r_3 = 1\\).\nThe attack described above is known as a conditional abort attack. Note that simply changing the threshold in the valid dealer definition does not help: A malicious dealer can always send private values to the honest parties in a way that the values revealed by these parties are just not enough to include the value in the final result. This way, the colluding receiver always has the option to decide whether the contribution of the malicious dealer should be accounted for.\nOur Solution\nTo address the issue above, in our solution we ensure that the generated random bit is fixed prior to the reveal phase. To achieve this, we rely on a well-known cryptographic primitive, a \\((t, n)\\)-verifiable secret sharing (VSS) protocol. Using such a protocol, a dealer can share its secret among \\(n\\) parties in a way that any \\(t + 1\\) parties can reconstruct the secret, but any \\(t\\) (potentially corrupted) parties possess no information about the secret. VSS further provides the so-called strong commitment property, which states that the shares of the honest parties define a secret (which could be \\(\\bot\\)).\nNow, similar to the strawman solution above, we can let \\(t + 1\\) dealers each contribute their secret randomness. However, instead of simply committing to the randomness and sending the opening information to every recipient, we use VSS to share each secret. By the strong commitment property we know that the secret of each dealer is defined by the shares of the honest share receivers.\nDesigning a YOSO-friendly VSS\nAs a first step towards the solution outlined above, we design a \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\)-friendly VSS scheme. We build our protocol around the well-known Pedersen VSS. The standard non-YOSO version of this VSS requires four rounds, described below. Here, \\(s\\) is the secret that is being shared, and \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) are generators of a group where computing discrete logarithms is hard (in particular, we assume that \\(\\log_gh\\) is not known to any party). Assuming that \\(t\\) parties can be corrupt, the number of receivers \\(R_i\\) needs to be at least \\(2t+1\\).\n\n\nThe dealer \\(D\\) chooses two degree-\\(t\\) polynomials\n$$f_1(x)=a_0 + a_1x + \\cdots + a_tx^t,$$\n$$f_2(x)=b_0 + b_1x + \\cdots + b_tx^t$$\nsuch that \\(b_0=s\\). Then, \\(D\\) broadcasts commitments $$(c_0, c_1, \\cdots, c_t) = (g^{a_0}h^{b_0}, g^{a_1}h^{b_1} \\cdots , g^{a_t}h^{b_t}),$$ and sends \\(r_i=f_1(i)\\) and \\(s_i=f_2(i)\\) to each \\(P_i\\), \\(i \\in [n]\\).\nEach party \\(R_i\\) checks whether \\(g^{r_i}h^{s_i} = \\prod_{k = 0}^{t} c_k^{i^k}\\). If not, \\(R_i\\) broadcasts \\(\\textsf{Complain}\\).\n\\(D\\) broadcasts all shares from parties who complained. If any share that \\(D\\) broadcasts does not satisfy the above relation, \\(D\\) is deemed corrupt and the execution halts. Otherwise, each \\(P_i\\) who complained replaces its old share with the new\n\\((r_i,s_i)\\).\nEach \\(R_i\\) outputs \\(r_i, s_i\\). The value \\(s=f_2(0)\\) is the reconstructed secret.\n\n\n\nIn the construction above, the dealer and each share recipient \\(R_i\\) speak twice – the dealer is required to come back in the third round to resolve the complaints, and each \\(R_i\\) might complain in the second round, and is then required to output its share in the fourth round. This violates the YOSO setting, where each party participates only once. We adapt this scheme to \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\) in two steps: First, we split the dealer execution into two steps, i.e., we use two different parties \\(D^1\\) and \\(D^2\\) for the dealer. We  let \\(D^1\\) execute the first round of the protocol above and send its state privately to \\(D^2\\). \\(D^2\\) can then execute the third round of the protocol. Similarly, we split the execution for each share recipient \\(R_i\\) into two steps, one of which is executed by party \\(R^1_i\\), and another by party \\(R^2_i\\). We let \\(R^1_i\\) execute the second round of the protocol above and send its state to its counterpart \\(R^2_i\\). Then, \\(R^2_i\\) can execute the fourth round of the protocol above as the original party \\(R_i\\).\nNote that this construction does not entirely correspond to the traditional definition of VSS, as we now need both \\(D^1\\) and \\(D^2\\) to behave honestly in order to guarantee security of the value shared by \\(D^1\\). However, this version of VSS is nevertheless sufficient for our purposes, because we are interested only in preserving the secrecy of one out of \\(t+1\\) VSS executions.\nA final issue remains: Currently, we assume that \\(g,h\\) are publicly known values, and the construction above is secure assuming that \\(\\log_gh\\) is not known to any party. How can we remove this assumption? Is it possible to let each dealer simply supply its own pair of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\)? Unfortunately not: If a malicious dealer knows \\(\\log_gh\\) and colludes with a party \\(R_i\\), then \\(R_i\\) could cheat by choosing one out of many valid openings, thus changing the reconstructed secret value. To fix this, we substitute computationally Pedersen commitments by unconditionally binding ElGamal commitments. In more detail, we now compute the commitment \\((c_0, c_1, \\cdots, c_t)\\) as follows:\n$$ (c_0, c_1, \\cdots, c_t)=\\left((g^{a_0}, h^{a_0}\\cdot g^{b_0}),  (g^{a_1}, h^{a_1}\\cdot g^{b_1}), \\cdots , (g^{a_t}, h^{a_t}\\cdot g^{b_t})\\right).$$\nThis way, even though a dealer knows \\(\\log_gh\\), the prior attack is impossible, as there simply do not exits two different openings that correspond to the same commitment.\n\nOptimizing the Number of Receivers\nWhen implemented naively, the construction outlined above requires \\(6t+4\\) parties: \\(t+1\\) dealers of type \\(D^1\\), each of which uses the same set of \\(2t+1\\) receivers of type \\(R^1_i\\), then \\(t+1\\) dealers of type \\(D^2\\), and finally \\(2t+1\\) receivers of type \\(R^2_i\\).\nAs an optimization, we observe that in our execution-leaks model \\(t+1\\) receivers of type \\(R^2_i\\) are sufficient. Consider the following change to our VSS construction above. Let each receiver \\(R^1_i\\) send its shares to all parties \\(R^2_j\\), instead of only sending it to its counterpart \\(R^2_i\\) as before. During the reconstruction, we then let each \\(R^2_j\\) publish all received shares. As in the execution-leaks scenario we assume that the channels to the future parties do not reveal any information until the corresponding recipient is executed (which in our case is after all dealers’ contributions are fixed), sending information to all parties \\(R^2_j\\) does not impact security.\nTogether with a few additional optimizations such as pipelining (see our paper for details), our protocol allows to achieve the following result:\n\nAssuming ElGamal commitments, there exists a computationally secure randomness generation protocol with \\(4t+4\\) parties in the execution-leaks model, where \\(t\\) is the number of corruptions.\n\n\nConclusions and Future Directions\nOur work achieves efficient distributed randomness generation in the worst-case YOSO model without any setup or heuristic assumptions.There are several exciting avenues for future research. First, there is still room to improve the\nrole-complexity of our \\(\\text{YOSO}^\\mathsf{WCC}\\) randomness generation protocols in the standard model (the same is true for the known information-theoretic protocols from the work by Nielsen, Ribeiro and Obremski). Next, it would be interesting to improve the communication complexity of our protocols. Finally, proving the lower bound for the communication complexity is another exciting problem.\n","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2024/yoso-randomness-generation/","title":"YOSO Randomness Generation with Worst-Case Corruptions"},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2025/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2025/","title":""},"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/2025/llm-checklist-assistant/":{"body":"Large language models (LLMs) represent a promising but controversial assistant in the process of preparing and reviewing scientific papers. They may serve as useful analytical tools to scrutinize manuscripts and identify possible weaknesses or inaccuracies that need addressing. However, the use of LLMs is fraught with issues of inaccuracy and bias — one pilot study that used GPT to judge the quality of paper abstracts found errors due to “a bias towards positive results, misinterpreting parameter ranges…[and] being swayed by bombastic language.” [1] Despite such risks, LLMs are already being used in the review of scientific papers [2,3]. Furthermore, the peer review process itself is increasingly under strain due to a rising tide of submissions in many fields, such as AI/ML and medicine [4]. This rise in submissions has led to an overtaxed reviewer pool, uneven quality of reviews, and many complaints from paper authors [5]. Given the fact that LLMs are already being widely adopted in the scientific peer review process, the pressing question becomes, “How can we harness LLMs responsibly and effectively to assist in the scientific peer review process?”\nIn an experiment at this year’s NeurIPS, a premier publication venue in AI / Machine Learning, we took an initial step towards answering this question. We evaluated a relatively clear-cut and low-risk use case: vetting paper submissions against submission standards, with results shown only to paper authors. We deployed an optional to use LLM-based “Checklist Assistant” to authors at NeurIPS 2024 as an assistant to check compliance with the NeurIPS Paper Checklist. The NeurIPS Paper Checklist is a series of yes/no questions that help authors check if their work meets reproducibility, transparency, and ethical research standards expected of scientific papers. The checklist is a critical component in maintaining standards of research presented at the conference. Adhering to the guidelines outlined by these checklists helps authors avoid mistakes that could lead to rejection during peer review.\nWe systematically evaluated the benefits and risks of an LLM Checklist Assistant focusing on two main questions:\n(1) Do authors perceive an LLM Author Checklist Assistant as a valuable enhancement to the paper submission process?\n(2) Does the use of an Author Checklist Assistant meaningfully help authors to improve their paper submissions?\n\nThe main takeaway is that an LLM Checklist Assistant can effectively aid authors in ensuring scientific rigor, but should likely not be used as a fully automated review tool that replaces human review.\n\n \nExample of checklist questions, answers, and LLM-provided Review from the Checklist Assistant (review shown highlighted).\n(1) Did authors find the Checklist Assistant useful?\nWe administered surveys both before and after use of the Checklist Assistant asking authors about their expectations for and perceptions of the tool. We received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey, 234 submissions to the Checklist Assistant and 78 responses to the post-usage survey.\n\nAuthors felt the Checklist Assistant was a valuable enhancement to the paper submission process. The majority of surveyed authors reported a positive experience using the LLM Checklist Assistant: &gt;70% of authors found it useful and &gt;70% said they would modify their paper in response to feedback.\n\nInterestingly, authors’ expectations of the assistant’s effectiveness were even more positive before using it than their assessments after actually using it. Comparing pre- and post-usage responses, there was a statistically significant drop in positive feedback on the “Useful” and “Excited to Use” questions.\n\nResponses to survey questions before and after using checklist verification (n=63 unique responses.)\n(2) What were the main issues authors had with the Checklist Assistant?\nWe also solicited freeform feedback on issues that the authors experienced using the Checklist Assistant, with responses grouped below.\n\nAmong the main issues reported by authors in qualitative feedback, the most frequently cited problems were inaccuracy (20/52 respondents) and that the LLM was too strict in its requirements (14/52 respondents).\n\n\nReported issues using checklist verification from freeform feedback on post-usage survey (n=52 out of 78 total survey responses.)\n(3) What kinds of feedback did the Checklist Assistant provide?\nWe used another LLM to extract key points from the Checklist Assistant’s responses for each question on the paper checklist and to cluster these points into overarching categories. Below we show the most frequent categories of feedback given by the Author Checklist Assistant on four questions of the checklist:\n\nClustering of most common types of feedback given by the LLM Checklist Assistant on four checklist questions.\n\nThe LLM was able to give concrete feedback to authors grounded in the content of their paper and checklist. The LLM tended to provide 4-6 distinct and specific points of feedback per question across the 15 questions. While it tended to give some generic boilerplate as part of its responses and to expand the scope of questions, it also was capable of giving concrete and specific feedback for many questions.\n\n(4) Did authors actually modify their submissions?\n\nAuthors reported in freeform survey responses reflect that they planned to make meaningful changes to their submissions—35/78 survey respondents provided specific modifications they would make to their submissions in response to the Checklist Assistant. This included improving justifications for checklist answers and adding more details to the paper about experiments, datasets, or compute resources.\n\nIn 40 instances, authors submitted their paper twice to the checklist verifier (accounting for 80 total paper submissions.) We find that of the 40 pairs of papers, in 22 instances authors changed at least one answer in their checklist (e.g., ‘NA’ to ‘Yes’) between the first and second submission and in 39 instances they changed at least one justification for a checklist answer. Of the authors who changed justifications on their paper checklist, many authors made a large number of changes, with 35/39 changing more than 6 justifications of the 15 questions on the checklist. While we cannot causally attribute these changes to the Checklist Assistant, they suggest that authors may have incorporated feedback from the assistant in between submissions.\nBelow, we show (multiplicative) increase in word count between initial submission and final submission on questions where authors changed justifications (a value of 2 corresponds to a doubling of the length of an answer). We find that over half the time when authors changed a checklist answer, they more than doubled the length of their justification.\n\nChange in word count of authors’ checklist responses between first and second submission to the Checklist Assistant. Over half the time, authors more than doubled the length of their checklist response.\nIn summary:\n\nWhen authors submitted to the Checklist Assistant multiple times they almost always made changes to their checklists between submissions and significantly lengthened their answers, suggesting that they may have added content in response to LLM feedback.\n\n(5) Can the Checklist Assistant be gamed?\nThe intended use of our Checklist Assistant was to help authors improve their papers, not to serve as a tool for reviewers to verify the accuracy of authors’ responses. If the system were used as an automated verification step as part of a review process, this could introduce an incentive for authors to “game” the system motivating the following question: could authors automatically improve the evaluations of their checklist responses with the help of AI, without making actual changes to their paper? If such gaming were possible, authors could provide a false impression of compliance to a conference without (much) additional effort and without actually improving their papers.\nTo assess whether our system is vulnerable to such gaming, we employed another LLM as an attack agent to iteratively manipulate the checklist justifications, aiming to deceive the Checklist Assistant. In this iterative process, the attack agent receives feedback from the system after each round and uses it to refine its justifications. We provided GPT-4o with the initial checklist responses and instructed it to revise the justifications based solely on feedback, without altering the underlying content of the paper. In particular, the attack agent outputs a modified paper checklist and we re-submitted the original paper with the modified checklist to our Checklist Assistant. We allowed the attack agent to do this for three iterations (reflecting the submission limit on our deployed assistant), with the agent selecting the highest scored response for each checklist question over the iterations.\nTo statistically quantify how attack success we submitted the selected justification to our Checklist Assistant for an evaluation “Score” (1 when the Checklist Assistant said the checklist question had “No Issues” and 0 when the Assistant identified issues.) Below we show the results of this attack:\n\n\nAuthors could adversarially improve their chance of passing an automated LLM Checklist review by modifying their checklist without modifying their paper: on 14 out of 15 questions our simple adversarial attack shows a score increase when comparing the unchanged justifications with those refined through three iterations of automated improvement.\n\nIn a manual examination of the changes made by the (attacker) LLM to the justifications, we found that the attacker LLM employed several illegitimate strategies, such as adding a hardware description that was not present in the paper or original justifications and generating a placeholder URL as a purported repository for the code. These illegitimate justifications were evaluated as adequate by the Checklist Assistant.\nConclusions\nOur deployment of an LLM-based paper Checklist Assistant at NeurIPS 2024 demonstrated that LLMs hold potential in enhancing the quality of scientific submissions by assisting authors in validating whether their papers meet submission standards. However, there were still notable limitations in deploying LLMs within the scientific peer review process that need to be addressed, in particular accuracy and alignment issues. Further, our system was not robust to gaming by authors, suggesting that while a Checklist Assistant could be useful as an aid to authors it may be a poor substitute for human review.\nFor more details, see the full paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03417.\nThis blog post is based on joint work with Ihsan Ullah, Thanh Gia Hieu Khuong, Benedictus Kent Rachmat, Zhen Xu, Isabelle Guyon, and Nihar B.

Is Coming for Mathematics, Too” was the title chosen by the NY Times in their dedicated article of 2024, “AI Will Become Mathematicians’ Co-Pilot” said the Scientific American, and the American Mathematical Society published “Questions Artificial Intelligence Raises for the Mathematics Profession”.\nThis time it does not seem to be a matter of sensationalistic journalism; some of the most respected mathematicians in the world are joining the conversation, with voices of concern, excitement, and a wide spectrum of positions in between. Perhaps the most aligned with the spirit of this research is Jordan Ellenberg, number theorist who co-authored FunSearch with DeepMind and stated (see Castekvecchi, 2023):\n\nWhat’s most exciting to me is modeling new modes of human–machine collaboration,\nI don’t look to use these as a replacement for human mathematicians, but as a force multiplier.\n\nThe goal of this post is to show through a concrete case study how SAT solvers, a relatively old AI technology, can also allow for human-machine collaboration in mathematics. Interestingly, the problem we study takes place in two-dimensional geometry, an a priori continuous domain, which makes the participation of SAT solvers somewhat surprising. While this is not the first usage of SAT in discrete geometry, its main novelty (besides the technical results) is in documenting how SAT solvers and other automated reasoning tools can assist mathematical research by revealing patterns and elliciting conjectures. At the end of the post I discuss verification—as opposed to recent language-based forms of AI, standard automated reasoning tools such as (Max)SAT solvers can provide proofs for their answers, which can be crucial for mathematics.\nThe Happy Ending was just the beginning\nIn 1933, Esther Klein presented the following problem to George Szekeres and Paul Erdős:\n\nProblem 1. If five points lie on a plane so that no three points form a straight line, prove that four of the points will form a convex quadrilateral.\n\nKlein’s solution is simple and elegant; almost entirely exposed in Figure 1. Note first that there are only three possible cases for the size of the convex hull of five points without collinearities. In case (a), where the convex hull includes all five points, any four of them make a convex quadrilateral. In case (b), where the convex hull has only four points, those four are the sought-after quadrilateral. In case (c), where the convex hull is a triangle, we consider the line \\(L\\) passing through the two points inside the triangle, which we call \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\), and then observe that the pigeonhole principle implies that one side of \\(L\\) must contain two of the three points in the convex hull, which we call \\(p_3\\) and \\(p_4\\); we are done, since the points \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) must form a convex quadrilateral.\n\n\nKlein’s problem kickstarted geometric Ramsey theory, and it was soon afterwards extended by Szekeres and Erdős into the following theorem:\n\nErdős-Szekeres Theorem. For any positive integer \\(k\\), there is an integer \\(g(k)\\) such that any collection of \\(g(k)\\) points contains either 3 collinear points or a convex \\(k\\)-gon.\n\nAs a second consequence of the problem, George Szekeres and Esther Klein married, which led Erdős to jokingly name Klein’s problem as the Happy Ending problem.\nNot only has Klein’s problem had a long-lasting impact in discrete geometry, her solution already contains an important insight: properties of finite point sets such as convexity do not rely on the specific coordinates of the points, but rather on their relative position and orientations, which are enough to determine the structure of e.g., convex hulls. This insight, as will become clear later in this post, is what opens the door to logical computation in a domain which may a priori seem continuous.\nThe problem: minimizing convex pentagons\nKlein’s proof shows \\(g(4) \\leq 5\\), and it is then easy to see that indeed \\(g(4) = 5\\). It is not too hard to see that \\(g(5) = 9\\) (see Figure 2), but it took until 2006 for \\(g(6) = 17\\) to be proven computationally by Lindsay Peters and George Szekeres. 1 No other values of \\(g(k)\\) are known, although  Erdős and Szekeres conjectured \\(g(k) = 2^{k-2} + 1\\) for all \\(k \\geq 3\\).\n\nIn 1973, a more quantitative variant was posed by Erdős and Guy:\n\nMore generally, one can ask for the least number of convex \\(k\\)-gons determined by \\(n\\) points in the plane [without three on a line].\n\nIndeed, let us denote by \\(\\mu_k(n)\\) the minimum number of convex \\(k\\)-gons on a placement of \\(n\\) points in the plane without any three on a common line. While \\(\\mu_4(n)\\) has been heavily studied, its close cousin \\(\\mu_5(n)\\) has received significantly less attention, and our goal was to remedy this situation. The following table summarizes our progress in computing \\(\\mu_5(n)\\), previously known up to \\(n = 11\\), and now solved up to \\(n = 16\\).\n# of points (\\(n\\))≤8910111213141516\nPreviously [2]0127[12, 13][20, 34][40, 62][60, 113]—\nOur work012712274277112\n\nA boolean representation of the problem\nAs suggested by Klein’s proof for \\(g(4)\\), it is possible to reason about properties like convexity based on combinatorial relationships between points instead of their concrete coordinates. Our goal in this section is to see how these relationships between points, and their impact on properties like convexity, can be encoded in propositional logic. The most successful combinatorial abstraction in geometric Ramsey theory is that of triple orientations,2 which intuitively consists of considering which oriented triples of points define a curve that turns counterclockwise, and which ones turn clockwise. Concretely, given points \\(p, q, r\\), their triple-orientation is defined as\n\\[\n\\sigma(p, q, r) =  \\text{sign} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} p_x &amp; q_x &amp; r_x \\\\ p_y &amp; q_y &amp; r_y \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{cases} -1 &amp; \\text{if } p, q, r \\text{ are oriented clockwise,} \\\\\n0 &amp; \\text{if } p, q, r \\text{ are collinear}, \\\\\n1 &amp; \\text{if } p, q, r \\text{ are oriented counterclockwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSince the problem disallows collinear points, we can ignore the case \\(\\sigma(p, q, r) = 0 \\), and thus note that each set of points \\((p_1, \\ldots, p_n)\\) induces a valuation of propositional variables \\(o_{i, j, k}\\) through \\(o_{i, j, k} \\iff \\sigma(p_i, p_j, p_k) = 1 \\). We will use these orientation variables, for \\(1 \\leq i &lt; j &lt; k \\leq n\\), to encode the convex-pentagon minimization condition, assuming without loss of generality that the points are labeled from left to right. The following figure illustrates how convexity is captured by triple orientations, and is invariant to the “details” of the coordinates (i.e., invariant under rotations, reflections, and infinitesimal perturbations)\n\nMore precisely, to encode whether a given \\(5\\)-tuple of points is convex or not with our orientation variables we can use an idea of Szekeres and Peters, 2006, who identified a nice separation of the cases leading to convex pentagons just in terms of the triple orientations.\n\nEvery possible convex pentagon falls into exactly one of these cases, and each of these cases can be described succinctly as follows:\n\nCase I:\n\\(\\sigma(a,b,c) =- \\sigma(b,c,d) = -\\sigma(c,d,e),\\)\nCase II:\n\\( \\sigma(a, b, c) =-\\sigma(b, c, e) = \\sigma(a,d,e),\\)\nCase III: \\( \\sigma(a,b,d) = -\\sigma(b, d, e) = \\sigma(a, c, e),\\)\nCase IV:  \\( \\sigma(a, b, e) = -\\sigma(a, c, d) = -\\sigma(c, d, e).\\)\n\nWe can thus easily encode these cases through the boolean orientation variables. For example, the fact that a tuple \\((a,b,c,d,e)\\) does not fall into the first case can be expressed by the formula\n\\[\nF^I_{a,b,c,d,e} := (o_{a,b,c} \\rightarrow (o_{b,c,d} \\vee o_{c,d,e})) \\wedge (\\neg {o_{a,b,c}} \\rightarrow (\\neg o_{b,c,d} \\vee \\neg o_{c,d,e})),\n\\]\nand similarly, we can construct formulas \\(F^{II}_{a,b,c,d,e}, F^{III}_{a,b,c,d,e}, F^{IV}_{a,b,c,d,e} \\) for the remaining cases.\nThen, it is easy to write each of these formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), the format supported by most solvers. The conjunction of all these, over all 5-tuples of points indexed by \\([n]\\), results in a formula \\(\\Phi_n\\) such that each convex pentagon on a set of \\(n\\) points in general position would induce exactly one falsified clause in \\(\\Phi_n\\). Moreover, some additional symmetry-breaking constraints can be added to the \\(\\Phi_n\\) in order to reduce the search space and make the local search more efficient, but we will not discuss them here in order to simplify our exposition. A detailed description, including formally verified proofs of correctness, can be found in  Subercaseaux et al., 2024.\n\n\nLocal search\nAt this point, we can use a local search SAT solver (e.g., Tassat (Chowdhury, Codel, Heule, 2023)) to try to minimize the number of falsified clauses in the formula \\(\\Phi_n\\), and thus, indirectly, the number of convex pentagons among \\(n\\) points. We need however to declare two caveats:\n\nLocal search solvers can get stuck at local minima, so the number of falsified clauses they obtain is only an upper bound of the true answer.\nUnfortunately, the upper bound on the number of falsified clauses does not provide an upper bound on the minimum number of convex pentagons, since assignments to the orientation variables might not be realizable by any set of actual points in the plane. In fact, the realizability problem of deciding whether an assignment to the orientation variables matches the orientations of some set of points in the plane is \\(\\exists \\mathbb{R} \\)-complete, so much harder than SAT itself.\n\nDespite these worst-case warnings, by running local search we obtained the following results:\n\n\n\\(n\\)Min. false clstime [s]\n910.00\n1020.00\n1170.00\n12120.00\n13270.01\n14420.01\n15770.01\n161120.02\n171820.02\n182522.03\n193780.94\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)Min. false clstime [s]\n20504174.11\n217143.34\n2292443.92\n23125411.64\n241584472.33\n25207963.48\n2625745268.1\n2732891555.5\n2840041791.9\n295005467.36\n30600718244\n\n\n\nCan you notice any patterns?\nFor a first observation, let’s see the sequence of differences between consecutive values:\n\\( 1, 5, 5, 15, 15, 25, 25, 70, 70,\n126, 126, …\\) These is hardly a coincidence, as we will show later. But more importantly, can we see a function that describes this sequence? Wolfram Mathematica certainly can! If we interpolate the first ten even values by a degree 5-polynomial (a natural guess since these are a fraction of the 5-tuples of points), the answer is immediate: \\( 2\\binom{N/2}{5}\\). This formula matches all the even terms except the last one, which is off by one. Considering the runtime and the fact that it’s also the first time the consecutive differences differ (\\(6007 - 5005 \\neq 5005 -4004\\)), the simplest interpretation is that local search caps out around \\(n = 30\\), but the answer most likely is indeed \\(6006\\).\nPlaying with the odd values quickly suggests the following conjecture for all values of \\(n\\):\n\\[\n\\mu_5(n) = \\binom{\\lfloor{n/2}\\rfloor}{5} + \\binom{\\lceil{n/2}\\rceil}{5}.\n\\]\nNote that this conjecture directly implies the observation about consecutive differences:\n\\[\n\\mu_5(2n) - \\mu_5(2n-1) = 2\\binom{n}{5} - \\left(\\binom{n}{5} + \\binom{n-1}{5}\\right) = \\binom{n}{5} - \\binom{n-1}{5},\n\\]\nand similarly\n\\[\n\\mu_5(2n-1) - \\mu_5(2n-2) = \\left(\\binom{n}{5} + \\binom{n-1}{5}\\right) - 2\\binom{n-1}{5} = \\binom{n-2}{5} - \\binom{n-2}{4}.\n\\]\nConstructions\nAs we mentioned, however, we have no a-priori guarantee that the local search solutions are actually realizable by points in the plane. In fact, the fraction of orientation assignments that can be realized goes to zero as \\(n\\) grows, at a rate of \\(2^{-n}\\) (Knuth, 1992).\nOnce again, not discouraged by the worse-case analysis, implementing a realizability program yields insightful results. 3  Indeed, by realizing different assignments for \\( n = 12\\), we obtained two classes of realizations:\n\nNaturally, we gave John Mackey, the mathematician in the group, the task of proposing general constrictions of these forms.\nWe called the left one a pinwheel construction, and the right one a parabolic construction.\n\nInterestingly, they both give the conjectured answer in general, thus making it a proper upper bound.\n\nTheorem 1: For every \\(n \\geq 9\\), we have \\(\\mu_5(n) \\leq \\binom{\\lfloor{n/2}\\rfloor}{5} + \\binom{\\lceil{n/2}\\rceil}{5}\\).\n\nSeeing this in the pinwheel construction requires a bit of work, but in the parabolic construction it is rather easy to see. It suffices to show, as the following figure illustrates, that the subsets of 5 points that are convex are precisely those that are contained in a single parabola.\n\nNaturally, even the parabolic construction requires some care in the design of the parabolas. A concrete construction that works is:\n\\[\np^\\top_i = \\left(i, 2  + \\frac{i^2}{n^2}\\right), \\forall i \\in  \\left[\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor \\right] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\np^\\bot_i = \\left(i, -2  - \\frac{i^2}{n^2}\\right), \\forall i \\in \\left[\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rceil \\right].\\\n\\]\nVerification\nSince local search solvers cannot prove lower bounds, we used a  MaxSAT formulation to certify the values \\(\\mu_5(n)\\) for \\(n \\leq 15\\). Concretely, the solver that performed best was MaxCDCL (Li et al., 2021), and we used a Cube and Conquer (Heule, Kullman, Biere, 2018) approach to parallelize the computation. Then, the VeritasPBLib (Gocht et al., 2022) framework allowed us to obtain a reproducible certificate. The details are purposefully omitted here, but the important part is that SAT and MaxSAT solvers can emit checkable proofs of their results, and moreover, some of the proof-checkers have been formally verified in theorem provers such as Coq, Lean, or CakeML. See e.g., Tan, Heule, and Myreen, 2021.\nLet’s make it 16.\nWe can actually leverage the insight of the consecutive differences from earlier on to certify the value of \\(\\mu_5(16)\\) without having to run a MaxSAT solver.\nFirst, consider the following supersaturation lemma.\n\nLemma 2: For every \\(n &gt; 5\\), we have \\(\\mu_5(n) \\geq \\frac{n}{n-5} \\cdot \\mu_5(n-1)\\).\n\nProof. Consider a set of \\(n\\) points \\(S\\) that achieves the optimal bound, and for each point \\(p \\in S\\) let \\(f(p)\\) be the number of convex pentagons in \\(S\\) that contain \\(p\\). As pentagons consist of exactly five points, we have \\(\\sum_{p \\in S} f(p) = 5 \\cdot \\mu_5(n)\\). Now, notice that for every \\(p\\) there must be at least \\(\\mu_5(n-1)\\) convex pentagons that do not contain \\(p\\), and thus we have \\( \\mu_5(n) - f(p) \\geq \\mu_5(n-1)\\). Summing this equation over \\(p\\) gives us\n\\[\n\\sum_{p \\in S} (\\mu_5(n) - f(p)) \\geq n \\cdot \\mu_5(n-1),\n\\]\nand as \\(\\sum_{p \\in S} (\\mu_5(n) - f(p)) = n \\cdot \\mu_5(n) - 5 \\cdot \\mu_5(n)\\), we have the desired inequality.\nNow, combining this with Theorem 1, we can formalize our previous observation:\n\nTheorem 2: If for some \\(n &gt; 5\\) it holds that \\(\\mu_5(2n-1) = \\binom{n}{5} + \\binom{n-1}{5}\\), then we have \\(\\mu_5(2n) = 2\\binom{n}{5}\\).\n\nProof. We have \\(\\mu_5(2n) \\leq 2\\binom{n}{5}\\) by Theorem 1, and thus to see that equality is achieved we use Lemma 2 to obtain\n\\[\n\\mu_5(2n) \\geq \\frac{2n}{2n-5} \\mu_5(2n-1) = \\frac{2n}{2n-5} \\left(\\binom{n}{5} + \\binom{n-1}{5}\\right),\n\\]\nand since \\(\\binom{n}{5} = \\frac{n}{n-5} \\binom{n-1}{5}\\), we have\n\\[\n\\frac{2n}{2n-5} \\left(\\binom{n}{5} + \\frac{n-5}{n} \\binom{n}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2n}{2n-5} + \\frac{2(n-5)}{2n-5}\\right)\\binom{n}{5} = 2\\binom{n}{5}.\n\\]\nThus, from the fact \\(\\mu_5(15) = 77\\), we conclude that \\(\\mu_5(16) = 112\\).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have seen, through a concrete case study, how SAT solvers, coupled with other computational tools, can assist mathematical research at different stages. At the moment, the mathematical community is still trying to understand how to best leverage AI for mathematics, and it is important to document how existing tools can also be used in this context. While the current conversation is centered around language models, I strongly believe that classical AI tools are still vastly underutilized by the mathematical community, and I plan to keep working on tools, algorithms, and logical encodings that might make them more popular among mathematicians.\nThis blog is based on joint work with John Mackey, Marijn J.
