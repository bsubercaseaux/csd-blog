          <description><![CDATA[

The workload of state-vector quantum circuit simulation is massively parallel. Most quantum gates multiply one small matrix to many vectors, and the workload is balanced.
Challenge: the state vector is too large to be stored on one GPU, and the communication cost is very high. â€¦ ]]></description>
