          <description><![CDATA[Part of the challenge (and fun) of low-level systems code is in the optimizations they employ:
developers might use manual memory management, they might use bit-packing and bit-twiddling optimizations,
or they might use multi-threading to speed up their code.
When dealing with su… ]]></description>
